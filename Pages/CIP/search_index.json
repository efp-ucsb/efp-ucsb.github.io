The percentage of weekly water quality tests that exceed state and federal standards for fecal coliform and enterococcus. This data is from the County Ocean Water Monitoring Program, which tests ocean water near the mouth of most major creeks in the Santa Barbara County. A reading of more than 400 parts per million for fecal coliform, 104 for enterococcus, or 10,000 MPN (Most Probable Number, meaning the bacterial count per 100 mL of water) for total coliform exceeds state and federal standards, and can lead to a Department of Environmental Health Beach Advisory. Why are they important? The quality of water coming out of a watershed directly reflects what goes into the watershed and is an indicator of the watershed’s overall health. This not only affects the ability of residents to enjoy local creeks and beaches, but also affects the health of wildlife. In addition, unsafe beaches can adversely impact the local economy by reducing tourism. How are we doing? Water quality violation days have remained relatively stable over the last five years, though there was a small increase in fecal coliform. Still, less than ten percent of tests had results where bacteria exceeded state and federal standards. The amount of rainfall can significantly affect these results, as rainfall flushes bacteria and pollutants from the creeks into the ocean. Water Consumption Declines What is the measure? The amount of gallons of water consumed per day for residential purposes by the customers of all the principal water agencies within the Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? The amount of water consumed by residents of Santa Barbara County is especially important in times of drought conditions. The County has taken several steps to reduce residential water consumption, which appears to have had a positive effect on lowering water usage. How are we doing? The current drought has reduced countywide water consumption, with marked decreases beginning in 2013. Montecito, Santa Ynez, and La Cumbre continue to have the highest personal consumption of water out of the County, whereas Guadalupe, Santa Maria, Lompoc, Goleta, Carpinteria, and Santa Barbara have the lowest per capita water consumption in the county. Residential water consumption is at its lowest rate in ten years. Air Quality Ozone Violation Days Significantly Reduced What is the measure? The number of days in which local communities did not meet the state standard for ozone levels. If a daily ozone reading exceeds an hourly average of 0.09 parts per million, or an eight hour average of 0.07 parts per million, a state “violation day” occurs. Why is it important? Ozone – one of the primary components of smog – impairs normal functioning of the lungs and reduces the ability to perform physical exercise. Lack of ozone in the air is considered to be a good indicator of overall air quality. How are we doing? In 2016, Santa Barbara County only experienced three days of ozone violation where the air quality exceeded the state 8-hour standard. While this is an increase of one day from 2015 statistics, air quality has improved dramatically over the past twenty years, even despite a rise in population. In October 2015, the EPA passed a new federal mandate reducing the 8-hour ozone violation from 0.075 parts per million to 0.070 parts per million. Santa Barbara County is currently in attainment of the 8-hour federal ozone standard. No Businesses Release Toxic Air Pollutants in 2015 What is the measure? The number of businesses in Santa Barbara County that release airborne toxic contaminants which exceed the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District’s thresholds for significant health risks. Three categories of toxic chemicals are measured – those that pose cancer risks, those that pose acute health risks, and those that pose chronic health risks unrelated to cancer. Why is it important? Toxic air contaminants pose a direct threat to the health of people who work at businesses that exceed safety thresholds and to those who live or work immediately adjacent to those businesses. In addition, the toxic contaminants harm overall air quality in the Santa Barbara County. How are we doing? The number of businesses exceeding health risk thresholds has dropped to zero in 2015. This is even more significant when stricter changes in guidelines are taken into account; in 2015, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment revised the guidance manual to account for sensitivity to cancer at early ages, possibly resulting in increased risk results. Land Use Pesticide Use Rises Slightly Over Past Year What is the measure? The total pounds of pesticide used in agriculture throughout Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? Many activities can affect ground and groundwater quality, most of which are difficult to track. Agricultural pesticide use is one possible precursor to ground or groundwater contamination. Pesticide use in the county is mostly within North County. How are we doing? After a large spike in pesticide use in 2012 – amounting to 6.18 million pounds – its use declined significantly in 2013. Since then, it has increased slightly to 4.78 million pounds. The lowest levels of pesticide usage were observed in 2009, with only 3.73 million pounds. Strawberries Dominate Pesticide Use Sites What is the measure? The top five sites of pesticide use throughout Santa Barbara County in 2014. Why is it important? Countywide pesticide use totaled 4,782,176 pounds in 2014. Of that, five types of crops constituted 82 percent of all pesticide use. These crops may be located in specific agricultural areas where pesticide use becomes more concentrated. How are we doing? The strawberry crop is the leading site for pesticide use in Santa Barbara County, with 2,532,990 pounds of pesticides used in 2014. From 2013 to 2014, raspberries and lemons fell from the top pesticide sites and were replaced by lettuce and flowers. Workplace Pesticide Related Illnesses and Injuries Increase What is the measure? The number of workplace pesticide related illnesses and injuries experienced in the Santa Barbara County. This measure includes antimicrobial agents such as chlorine. Why is it important? Many factors influence our health, including environmental factors. Workplace pesticide related illnesses are one of those that are regularly tracked. How are we doing? The number of reported illnesses related to pesticides has typically remained under 20 cases a year, with three major exceptions. The past two years saw a dramatic increase in the number of workplace pesticide related illnesses. From 2012 to 2013, there was over a 200 percent increase in the number of pesticide related illnesses. While 2014’s numbers have decreased to 47 cases, they are still much higher than the typical number of cases in prior years. Energy Use Decreases What is the measure? The amount of electricity consumed by the Santa Barbara County for commercial, residential, and industrial purposes, measured in gigawatt hours. (One gigawatt hour equals one thousand megawatt hours.) Why is it important? Electric energy is a critical commodity, integrated into every aspect of our lives in our homes and workplaces. However, the production of electricity may have negative environmental impacts through pollution and resource use. How are we doing? Santa Barbara County energy use contines to decrease, dropping to its lowest consumption levels in over ten years. Mobility Most Workers Commute Alone by Car What is the measure? The respective percentages of Santa Barbara County residents’ means of transport to work. This data is collected by the United States Census in the American Community Survey. Why is it important? Mobility reflects the ability of people to get from one place to another efficiently; consequentially, traffic congestion prevents this from happening. While traffic congestion has many components – including the level of non-commuter automobile use, population, the success of land-use planning, and the ability of infrastructure improvements to adapt to changes – the level of single occupancy vehicle use has a direct impact on overall traffic congestion. How are we doing? The majority of workers choose to commute alone by car. The proportion of these commuters has remained stable over the past five years. Mean Commute Time Declines Marginally What is the measure? The average amount of time it takes a commuter in Santa Barbara County to travel to work. Why is it important? Commute distances traveled can reveal much about the quality of life and future trends. Changing commute patterns may indicate a greater sensitivity toward housing costs and the economy. As the distance traveled increases, so does pollution, emission levels from automobiles, and traffic congestion. How are we doing? The average commute time in 2019 was 19.4 minutes. Over the past twelve years, the mean commute time has remeained relatively constant around 20 minutes. Bus Ridership Decreasing What is the measure? The number of bus trips taken in Santa Barbara on Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) buses. Why is it important? Buses are popular means of alternative transportation in Santa Barbara. In many cases, they are the transportation mode of choice for those who cannot afford an automobile or are unable to drive. How are we doing? Total bus ridership has declined recently to about 6.5 million in 2019, the lowest ridership levels in our data. Bus ridership levels peaked in 2009 with 8.3 million rides that year. Traffic Volumes Stabilize Over Last Five Years What is the measure? The number of cars per day on the freeway counted at three interchanges in Santa Barbara County. The interchanges are Highway 101 at Fairview, Las Positas, and Sheffield. Why is it important? Highway 101 is a major roadway in Santa Barbara County, carrying local traffic, commuters from outside of the area, tourists, and other traffic. As the major traffic artery in the area, this highway plays an important role in the mobility of local residents. How are we doing? As shown on the graph, traffic volume has stayed relatively stable over the past decade. Las Positas and Sheffield have both seen slight decreases in their traffic volume, even though all three interchanges have not seen much change in volume over the last few years. Resource Use Total Waste Disposed Sees Slight Increase What are the measures? The total tons of waste disposed in the Tajiguas, Santa Maria, and Lompoc landfills, as well as the amount of green waste and recycling diverted from the landfills. Why is it important? Waste disposal is a major form of urban pollution. Growing populations cause the total amount of waste to increase. Changes in the local economy, consumer purchasing decisions, and recycling and composting efforts also affect the amount of waste. How are we doing? The total waste disposed in the Santa Maria and Lompoc landfills increased by about two thousand tons each, reaching 90,534 and 37,554 tons respectively. However, the Tajiguas landfill (which serves most of the South Coast) has seen a larger upward tick in total waste disposed, moving from 175,099 tons to 191,598 tons. The total amount of green waste has increased in 2015 from 158 to 160 pounds per capita, whereas the total recyclables diverted decreased from 100 to 96 pounds per capita. California currently has a statewide goal of reducing solid waste by 75 percent by 2020 through recycling, composting, and source reduction. As of last year, recovery percentage for Santa Barbara County is 50 percent. Nature Total Bird Count Experiences a Decline What is the measure? The results of the Audobon Society’s annual Christmas Bird Count for five species. The bird count is designed as a measure of the diversity of bird species, but it can also be used as a rough indicator of how well bird species are thriving. Five common species are reported - the California Quail, the Nuttall’s Woodpecker, the American Crow, the Wrentit, and the Western Meadowlark. All of these species are resident birds, living in different local habitats. Why is it important? Bird populations are an important part of out local ecosystem, and generally reflect its overall health. Changes in the bird count can reflect changes in habitat or other shifts in local environment. How are we doing? For the past decade, the number of Nuttall’s Woodpeckers, Wrentits, and Western Meadowlarks have generally declined. These species have decreased mainly due to the loss of local chapparral and woodlands. However, the number of sightings of American Crows has seen a 36 percent increase from 2005 to 2015. In 2015, Western Meadowlarks sightings fell dramatically from 720 to 376, a 47 percent decline. This decrease is surprising considering the 129 percent increase seen from 2013 to 2014. Similar to the Western Meadowlarks, the number of California Quails also fell by 26 percent moving from 2014 to 2015 after increasing considerably the years before. The sightings of Wrentits and Nuttall’s Woodpecker’s generally stayed the same, although remaining on a downward trend. As most of the species decline, the number of American Crows sightings continues to grow, representing more than half of the total bird count. "]]
