North County has a larger proportion of their population below the age of 14 compared to the South Coast. The South Coast has a much larger proportion of their population over the age of 55. Household Income Distribution What is the measure? The percent of households falling in certain income ranges for North County, the South Coast, and California in 2018. Why is it important? The overall health of a community depends on the ability of its residents to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. The income distribution breaks down the earnings and allows us to examine the percent of families that can afford a certain quality of life. We can use the income distribution to draw an overview of the economic composition of the community and how it compares to California. How are we doing? The South Coast tends to be wealthier than North County and California, with higher percentages of its residents falling at the upper end of the income distribution range. Past the $100,000 per year mark, we see that North County is consistently higher than both California and South Coast. For both areas of the county, there is a smaller percent of households making less than $15,000 than California as a whole. Neighborhood and Community Well-Being Crime Rates Remain Low What are the measures? These crime rates measure the number of property and violent crimes per 1,000 people in North County and in the South Coast. Violent crimes include homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, whereas property crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other theft. Why are the measures important? Crime affects the level of real and perceived safety, which greatly impacts the health of neighborhoods. In some cases, the reality and perception of safety can be different. How are we doing? Violent crimes have fallen in both North County and the South Coast over the last several years. In 2017, violent crime was low at 2.24 crimes per 1,000 people for the South Coast, which represents a 0.451 percent increase over 2016. On the other hand, there was a 2.73 percent decrease in violent crime in North County over the past year, with 3.21 crimes per 1,000 inhabitants. Property crime rates have fallen in both North County, with an 8 percent decrease, and in the South Coast, with a 14 percent decrease. Juvenile Felony Arrests Remain Lowest in Decade What is the measure? The number of juvenile felony arrests in Santa Barbara County per 1,000 adolescents, including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and larceny. Why is it important? The rate of juvenile crime not only impacts our community in the short term through property and violent crime, but also has larger implications at the societal level. Juvenile deliquency is costly both for the minors themselves and the victims of their crimes. How are we doing? The juvenile felony arrest rate has been steadily decreasing since about 2008 and reached a record low in 2018. Despite a small uptick in 2019, juvenile crime overall is declining. Rate of Births to Teenage Mothers Declining What is the measure? The number of children born to women between the ages of 15-19 per 1,000 women in that age range. Why is it important? Teenage mothers and children are at high risk. Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school and suffer complications during pregnancy and birth. Babies of teenage mothers are more likely to face low birth weight, premature delivery, infant death and health problems post-birth. Children of teenage mothers are also more likely to drop out of high school, be incarcerated, become teenage parents and face unemployment. How are we doing? The teen birth rate has been steadily declining and received its lowest point in 2018, at a rate of 16.5 births per 1,000 teens. Mothers Receiving Inadequate Prenatal Care Drops What is the measure? The percentage of total births in the Santa Barbara County in which the mother does not receive any prenatal care within the first three months of pregnancy. Why is it important? Adequate and early prenatal care increases the chance of a healthy pregnancy and birth. It also helps monitor and prevent complications. Babies of mothers who did not receive prenatal care are more likely to have a low birth weight and to die in infancy. How are we doing? Santa Barbara has greatly improved in this metric in recent years, falling from 22% in 2018 to 15.26% in 2020. Still, the county continues to lag behind the state as a whole, which exhibits similar trends in rises and falls. Infant Mortality Rates Decrease What is the measure? The number of deaths of infants one year and under per 1,000 live births in Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? The infant mortality rate is a strong indicator of the overall health of a society, according to the CDC, and reflect the quality of infrastructure such as nutrition, medical care and sanitation. How are we doing? Infant mortality rates decreased sharply from 2019 to 2020, falling from 4.65 to 2.25 deaths per 1,000 live births. Santa Barbara generally has a lower infant mortality rate than the state of California overall. Citizen Engagement Voter Turnout Increases What are the measures? The share of the eligible population that was registered to vote in each year and the share of registered voters who voted in past elections in Santa Barbara County. Why are they important? Voter registration and turnout measure the most basic forms of civic participation, and are surrogate measures for the level of interest residents have in community affairs. Broad-based citizen involvement not only improves the accountability of government, but also creates a critical fabric of support for all our institutions. How are we doing? Both voter registration and voting turnout increased in 2020, with 80.56% of eligible individuals registering to vote and 85.64% of registered voters casting a ballot. This was a record share of registered voters and a near-record share of ballots cast. This was the highest voter turnout percentage in a presidential election since 2004, where voter turnout was 85.80%. *** Santa Barbara County Trends Toward Voting for Democrat Candidates What is the measure? The share of voters in Santa Barbara who cast ballots for each party in presidential elections from 2000 to 2020. Why is it important? Voting trends by residents of Santa Barbara County reflect shifting political preferences in the region. Similar trends are found in the nation as a whole and may indicate increasing ideological division between parties. How are we doing? In 2000, voters in Santa Barbara County voted in near equal percentages for the Democratic and Republican candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush, at 47.29% and 46.06% respectively. Since then, there has been a steady increase in the share of county residents who have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate. In the most recent presidential election, 64.52% of ballots in the county were cast for Joseph R. Biden and 32.63% were cast for Donald J. Trump. "]]
