["index.html", "UCSB Economic Forecast Project Dear Residents,", " UCSB Economic Forecast Project Dear Residents, We are pleased to present the 2018 edition of the Santa Barbara Community Indicators Project (SBCIP). This is a revival of the South Coast Community Indicators Project that ran for six editions from 1998 to 2003. The Santa Barbara Community Indicators Project incorporates both North County and the South Coast in its measures, and is designed to give an overall picture of our community’s health and well-being. This project was made possible through the financial support provided by the Hutton-Parker Foundation, the Mosher Foundation, Montecito Bank &amp; Trust, and the Gretler Foundation. The Santa Barbara Community Indicators Project focuses on social, environmental, and economic data within our community. The quality of our lives is a reflection of the balance of social, environmental, and economic conditions. We encourage our community to engage with us to discover ways in which we can continually improve our health, safety and environment. "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction What is the Community Indicators Project? The Community Indicators Project is an effort to measure the social, environmental, and economic factors that make up the quality of life in our community. The project consists of the information in this report, additional data provided at our website (www.efp.ucsb.edu), as well as the process of generating the information. Both the product and the process are essential elements of the effort. Our mission is: To involve the Santa Barbara County community in developing and using social, environmental, and economic indicators that will guide decisions toward continually improving our quality of life. Each section contains the measures used to describe an issue, why those measures are useful and how our community is doing with regard to those measures. The data presented throughout this document cover a wide range of topics and, when possible, separates North County from the South Coast. This is done to better delineate the differences even within a relatively small area. These data should help us discover where our resources can be placed to reduce areas of concern. It is our hope that policy makers and our citizenry will use the information here to better our lives and well-being. "],

North County has a larger proportion of their population below the age of 14 compared to the South Coast. The South Coast has a much larger proportion of their population over the age of 55. Household Income Distribution What is the measure? The percent of households falling in certain income ranges for North County, the South Coast, and California in 2018. Why is it important? The overall health of a community depends on the ability of its residents to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. The income distribution breaks down the earnings and allows us to examine the percent of families that can afford a certain quality of life. We can use the income distribution to draw an overview of the economic composition of the community and how it compares to California. How are we doing? The South Coast tends to be wealthier than North County and California, with higher percentages of its residents falling at the upper end of the income distribution range. Past the $100,000 per year mark, we see that North County is consistently higher than both California and South Coast. For both areas of the county, there is a smaller percent of households making less than $15,000 than California as a whole. Neighborhood and Community Well-Being Crime Rates Remain Low What are the measures? These crime rates measure the number of property and violent crimes per 1,000 people in North County and in the South Coast. Violent crimes include homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, whereas property crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other theft. Why are the measures important? Crime affects the level of real and perceived safety, which greatly impacts the health of neighborhoods. In some cases, the reality and perception of safety can be different. How are we doing? Violent crimes have fallen in both North County and the South Coast over the last several years. In 2017, violent crime was low at 2.24 crimes per 1,000 people for the South Coast, which represents a 0.451 percent increase over 2016. On the other hand, there was a 2.73 percent decrease in violent crime in North County over the past year, with 3.21 crimes per 1,000 inhabitants. Property crime rates have fallen in both North County, with an 8 percent decrease, and in the South Coast, with a 14 percent decrease. Juvenile Felony Arrests Remain Lowest in Decade What is the measure? The number of juvenile felony arrests in Santa Barbara County per 1,000 adolescents, including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and larceny. Why is it important? The rate of juvenile crime not only impacts our communityb of how safe our community may be in the future. In addition, it reflects the effectiveness of intervention programs focused at teens and pre-teens. How are we doing? Juvenile arrests are at an all time low of 6.4 arrests per 1,000 adolescents, which is a 48.4 percent decrease over the past decade. However,over the past few years, the decrease has slowed and the rate is leveling out. Child Maltreatment Allegations Remain Constant What is the measure? The number of children in Santa Barbara County with at least one child maltreatment allegation, which includes sexual, emotional, and physical abuse, severe and general neglect, exploitation, caretaker absence/incapacity, and at risk allegations. If a child has more than one allegation in different categories, the child is only counted once. Why is it important? This is the best measure summarizing all types of child abuse and neglect encountered within the community. The consequence of child abuse impacts not only the child but on support services and school systems as well. How are we doing? In 2015, Santa Barbara County surpassed its previous peak in child maltreatment allegations with 5,533 cases. Child maltreatment allegations have consistently been on the rise since 2010. Individual and Family Well-Being DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL RATE DECREASES SLIGHTLY What is the measure? The domestic violence call rate is the number of 911 calls reported to police and sheriff departments in Santa Barbara County regarding domestic violence, including violence to children. This measure includes attacks with guns, knives, heavy objects, hands, fists, and feet. Why is it important? Domestic violence has tragic implications for the individual health and wellbeing of adults and children, and directly impacts the families to which they belong. Domestic violence may also be an indicator of the relative health of a community as a whole. How are we doing? The domestic violence call rate decreased marginally by 0.036 calls for South Coast and increased by 0.38 calls for the North County per 1,000 people in the past year. Both North County and South Coast experienced their lowest rate in 2008 at 3.9 and 1.4 calls per 1,000 people, respectively. This could indicate either a low in domestic violence or a reluctance to report in uncertain economic times. WEAPON-RELATED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL RATE What is the measure? This statistic measures the rate of calls to 911 in Santa Barbara County in which domestic violence with a weapon is reported. Weapons include guns, knives, heavy objects, hands, fists, and feet. This specifically excludes verbal abuse. How are we doing? For the South Coast, the rate of weapon-related domestic violence calls to 911 have fluctuated between a high of 2.76 calls per 1,000 people in 2005 and a low of 0.19 calls per 1000 in 2016. In North County, the year 2017 represented the highest rate of weapon-related calls at 3.65 per 1000, and 2009 represented the lowest at 2.4 calls. For the South Coast, the number of cases has remained fairly stable since 2011. RAPE CRIME RATES INCREASE What is the measure? The number of reported rapes, calculated as the rate per 1,000 people. Why is it important? Rape crimes play a very significant role in shaping the communityb crimes violate oneb How are we doing? For the past several years, there has been a fair amount of variance in the rape crime rate for both North County and the South Coast. The South Coast reached its highest rate at 0.697 incidents per 1,000 people in 2016 and has decreased to .53. North County reached its highest rate in the last year, with 0.553 incidents per 1,000 people. BIRTHS TO TEENAGE MOTHERS DECLINING What is the measure? The number of children born to women between the ages of 15-19 per 1000 women in that age range. Why is it important? Births to teens represent a growing social concern. While children of teenage mothers can be happy and healthy, they are at a higher risk of suffering health problems than other children. Teenage mothers may face great challenges in raising children because of the time conflicts with attending school, lack of experience with child care, and the lack of income necessary to provide for a child. How are we doing? The percentage of teen births in the Santa Barbara County reached its lowest point in 2016, reaching a rate of only 16.8 births per 1,000 teens. MOTHERS RECEIVING INADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE DROPS What is the measure? The percentage of total births in the Santa Barbara County in which the mother does not receive any prenatal care within the first three months of pregnancy. Why is it important? The level of prenatal care is not only a leading indicator of successful pregnancies, but also a predictor of a childb health later in life. How are we doing? In the past ten years, inadequate prenatal care has fluctuated reaching a peak of 28.4 percent in 2009. However, the percentage of mothers receiving inadequate prenatal care has decreased since then, hovering around 23.2 percent. In 2014, it dropped to 22.3 percent. INFANT MORTALITY RATES REMAIN LOW What is the measure? The number of deaths of infants one year and under per 1,000 live births in Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? In addition to the emotional damage caused to parents, high infant mortality rates are often an indication of a motherb abnormalities, low birthweight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or problems related to complications of pregnancies. How are we doing? Infant mortality rates decreased sharply from 2011 to 2012, falling from 4.8 to 2.9 deaths per 1,000 live births. The rate in 2013 remained stable at 2.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, decreasing only slightly from 2012 rate. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LUNCH ELIGIBILITY What is the measure? This program provides federally sponsored, free, or subsidized school lunch programs in local public elementary schools. Because families must demonstrate financial need in order to participate, this measure reflects the percentage of children living in families with low incomes. Currently eligible students come from households with incomes at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level. Why is it important? In many ways, children are the most sensitive to any negative forces in our families and communities. While it is true that many children from poorer families benefit from a solid family structure and do very well in society, financial strain is often seen as having a negative impact on a childb How are we doing? While school lunch participation generally increased throughout the late 2000s to early 2010s, recently the percentage of students eligible for the program has stagnated across the South Coast. When comparing the South Coast to North County and statewide levels, the South Coast has less participation in these programs. North County, however, has slightly more eligible students than the statewide average. Eligibility is at an all time high for North, South, and California. Poverty in the County POVERTY STATUS OF FAMILIES What is the measure? A breakdown of the composition of families with incomes at, above, and below poverty in Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? Understanding the composition of families living in poverty allows us to see which part of the population is suffering the most from poor wages. How are we doing? Most families with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level are families without children. 55 percent of the 12,369 households living in poverty in North County are families without children. 59 percent of the 4,666 households living in poverty in South Coast are families without children. NUMBERS OF MEALS SERVED INCREASES, 35 PERCENT OF THOSE SERVED ARE UNDER 18 What is the measure? The amount of food distributed by Santa Barbara County Foodbank, the number of people served in Santa Barbara County food kitchens, and the age of those served in 2016. Why are they important? People use food kitchens when they cannot afford to buy enough food for themselves or their families, and good nutrition is an essential part of staying healthy. The number of people using food banks is often indicative of the number of people living at or below the poverty level within a community. How are we doing? The pounds of food distributed and number of meals served in Santa Barbara County increased by 3 percent from 2014 to 2015, whereas the number of people served also increased by 3 percent from 146,198 to 150,409 people. This indicates that food contributions are rising at the same pace as the amount of people needing to be fed. Of the 150,409 people served in Santa Barbara County, 35 percent of them were under the age of 18. A considerable number of young people in Santa Barbara County live in families that do not earn enough money to provide adequate nutrition for their children. NUMBER OF HOMELESS USING HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FOLLOWS DECREASING TREND What is the measure? The number of users of the Health Care for the Homeless program broken down by gender. The Health Care for the Homeless program is federally funded and allows homeless people to receive medical attention. Why is it important? The overall health of a community depends on the physical and mental health of all of its members. Providing health care for the homeless permits more people in the community to remain in good health. How are we doing? The number of homeless people using the program has continued its downward trend since 2011. In 2015, 2,170 men and 1,391 women utilized this federal program, compared to 3,173 men and 1860 women in 2011. Given the challenges of attempting to measure the homeless and transient population, it is difficult to determine if these decreases reflect a smaller number of homeless people taking advantage of the program, or a decrease in the homeless population being served. Education SAT SCORES CONTINUE DOWNWARD TREND What is the measure? The Standard Aptitude Test (SAT) is designed to measure verbal, mathematical, and reading aptitude and is used as part of the admissions process at most universities. The score is also used as a benchmark in assessing and comparing the performance of secondary schools. The maximum possible score from these years is 2400. In 2016, the test format was changed, and cannot be compared to previous years. Why is it important? Whether high school students are prepared to enter the workforce or continue their education is key to their future opportunities and success. The general preparedness of our high school students has a great impact on our economy and community as a whole. How are we doing? The scores for South Coast high schools continue to lead benchmark data for the County and state by a large margin. The North County scores remain slightly below California scores. The most recent data shows a continued trend of falling SAT scores across all three areas. HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS TAKE THE SAT What is the measure? The percentage of high school seniors taking the SAT. Why is it important? Taking the SAT exam is an indication that a student hopes to attend a four-year college or university. Consequently, the percentage of students taking the SAT is a measure of how successfully the schools have prepared their students and of student aspirations. How are we doing? Despite a small drop in percentages for South Coast in the last year, it was offset by a rise in North County, and the trend of high school seniors taking the SAT appears to be rising across all three locations. However, it is important to note that less than half of high school students take the SAT, denoting those with aspirations for a college or university degree directly after high school. SOUTH COAST OUTSCORES NORTH COUNTY ON CAASPP What are the measures? The California Assessment of Student Performance Progress (CAASPP) is a newer program implemented to replace the Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) exam system. Designed to measure understanding of mathematical and verbal skills, the test is given to public school students in the County and then compared to other students in California. Why is it important? Similar to the SAT, these tests are designed to measure the preparedness and general education level of local students. The scores are also used as a benchmark in assessing and comparing the performance of schools. How are we doing? All six elementary school districts in the South Coast outperform the County in the percent of students that have met or exceeded the CAASPP standard for both English and Math. However, the statewide test results surpass those of the Santa Barbara and Carpinteria school districts. In North County, only the Ballard, Buellton, Los Olivos, and Solvang school districts score better than the California average. BOOK AND MAGAZINE CIRCULATION SURPASSES ONE MILLION What are the measures? We are tracking three measures by sub-area in Santa Barbara County: the volume of book and magazine circulation, the monthly average of library hours, and the volume of library audio-visual circulation. Why are they important? Public libraries provide supplemental educational resources for children, continuing education opportunities for adults, and an enhancement of the cultural quality of life. How are we doing? This data shows active use of library service throughout the Santa Barbara County. The average library hours has remained unchanged over the past three years. Meanwhile, book and magazine circulation surpassed one million books, and audio-visual circulation was nearly half a million units. Citizen Engagement VOTER REGISTRATION AND TURNOUT INCREASES What are the measures? These graphs measure the percent of the eligible population that is registered to vote and the percent of registered voters who voted in past elections in Santa Barbara County. Why are they important? Voter registration and turnout measure the most basic forms of civic participation, and are surrogate measures for the level of interest residents have in community affairs. Broad-based citizen involvement not only improves the accountability of government, but also creates a critical fabric of support for all our institutions. How are we doing? Voter registration increased in the 2016 Presidential Election, reaching 76.8 percent of eligible voters. This is the highest voter registration percentage in recent election cycles since 2004, where voter registration was 79.5 percent. The voter turnout for the presidential election also increased from 80.3 percent in 2012 to 81.7 percent in 2016. However, voter turnout in midterm elections has been decreasing, reaching its lowest levels of recent years in 2014. Cultural Resources PERFORMING ARTS TICKET SALES INCREASE AS NUMBER OF SHOWS SHOW A SLIGHT DECLINE What is the measure? The total ticket sales and number of performances at the Santa Barbara Bowl, the Lobero Theater, and UCSB Arts and Lectures. Why is it important? The arts are a critical part of the community fabric that offers a place where residents and visitors alike can come together, and enjoy the artistic expression of the human spirit. How are we doing? Total tickets sales for all three venues in 2015 was 232,168 dispalying an 11 percent increase from 2014; at the same time, the total number of shows declined 10%. Santa Barbara Bowl experienced a 23 percent spike in ticket sales, along with an increase of 6 events. Lobero Theater saw a decline of 7% in ticket sales corresponding with a 20 percent decrease of events throughout 2015. Similiarly, UCSB Arts and Lectures displayed a loss in ticket sales, but with roughly the same amount of events from the previous year. "],
["environmental.html", "Environmental Water Quality Air Quality Land Use Mobility Resource Use Nature", " Environmental .column-left{ float: left; width: 50%; text-align: left; } .column-right{ float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right; } Water Quality WATER QUALITY VIOLATION DAYS RELATIVELY STABLE What are the measures? The percentage of weekly water quality tests that exceed state and federal standards for fecal coliform and enterococcus. This data is from the County Ocean Water Monitoring Program, which tests ocean water near the mouth of most major creeks in the Santa Barbara County. A reading of more than 400 parts per million for fecal coliform, 104 for enterococcus, or 10,000 MPN (Most Probable Number, meaning the bacterial count per 100 mL of water) for total coliform exceeds state and federal standards, and can lead to a Department of Environmental Health Beach Advisory. Why are they important? The quality of water coming out of a watershed directly reflects what goes into the watershed and is an indicator of the watershed’s overall health. This not only affects the ability of residents to enjoy local creeks and beaches, but also affects the health of wildlife. In addition, unsafe beaches can adversely impact the local economy by reducing tourism. How are we doing? Water quality violation days have remained relatively stable over the last five years, though there was a small increase in fecal coliform. Still, less than ten percent of tests had results where bacteria exceeded state and federal standards. The amount of rainfall can significantly affect these results, as rainfall flushes bacteria and pollutants from the creeks into the ocean. WATER CONSUMPTION DECLINES What is the measure? The amount of gallons of water consumed per day for residential purposes by the customers of all the principal water agencies within the Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? The amount of water consumed by residents of Santa Barbara County is especially important in times of drought conditions. The County has taken several steps to reduce residential water consumption, which appears to have had a positive effect on lowering water usage. How are we doing? The current drought has reduced countywide water consumption, with marked decreases beginning in 2013. Montecito, Santa Ynez, and La Cumbre continue to have the highest personal consumption of water out of the County, whereas Guadalupe, Santa Maria, Lompoc, Goleta, Carpinteria, and Santa Barbara have the lowest per capita water consumption in the county. Residential water consumption is at its lowest rate in ten years. Air Quality OZONE VIOLATION DAYS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED What is the measure? The number of days in which local communities did not meet the state standard for ozone levels. If a daily ozone reading exceeds an hourly average of 0.09 parts per million, or an eight hour average of 0.07 parts per million, a state “violation day” occurs. Why is it important? Ozone – one of the primary components of smog – impairs normal functioning of the lungs and reduces the ability to perform physical exercise. Lack of ozone in the air is considered to be a good indicator of overall air quality. How are we doing? In 2016, Santa Barbara County only experienced three days of ozone violation where the air quality exceeded the state 8-hour standard. While this is an increase of one day from 2015 statistics, air quality has improved dramatically over the past twenty years, even despite a rise in population. In October 2015, the EPA passed a new federal mandate reducing the 8-hour ozone violation from 0.075 parts per million to 0.070 parts per million. Santa Barbara County is currently in attainment of the 8-hour federal ozone standard. NO BUSINESSES RELEASE TOXIC AIR POLLUTANTS IN 2015 What is the measure? The number of businesses in Santa Barbara County that release airborne toxic contaminants which exceed the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District’s thresholds for significant health risks. Three categories of toxic chemicals are measured – those that pose cancer risks, those that pose acute health risks, and those that pose chronic health risks unrelated to cancer. Why is it important? Toxic air contaminants pose a direct threat to the health of people who work at businesses that exceed safety thresholds and to those who live or work immediately adjacent to those businesses. In addition, the toxic contaminants harm overall air quality in the Santa Barbara County. How are we doing? The number of businesses exceeding health risk thresholds has dropped to zero in 2015. This is even more significant when stricter changes in guidelines are taken into account; in 2003, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment revised the guidance manual to account for sensitivity to cancer at early ages, possibly resulting in increased risk results. Land Use PESTICIDE USE RISES SLIGHTLY OVER PAST YEAR What is the measure? The total pounds of pesticide used in agriculture throughout Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? Many activities can affect ground and groundwater quality, most of which are difficult to track. Agricultural pesticide use is one possible precursor to ground or groundwater contamination. Pesticide use in the county is mostly within North County. How are we doing? After a large spike in pesticide use in 2012 – amounting to 6.18 million pounds – its use declined significantly in 2013. Since then, it has increased slightly to 4.78 million pounds. The lowest levels of pesticide usage were observed in 2009, with only 3.73 million pounds. STRAWBERRIES DOMINATE PESTICIDE USE SITES What is the measure? The top five sites of pesticide use throughout Santa Barbara County in 2014. Why is it important? Countywide pesticide use totaled 4,782,176 pounds in 2014. Of that, five types of crops constituted 82 percent of all pesticide use. These crops may be located in specific agricultural areas where pesticide use becomes more concentrated. How are we doing? The strawberry crop is the leading site for pesticide use in Santa Barbara County, with 2,532,990 pounds of pesticides used in 2014. From 2013 to 2014, raspberries and lemons fell from the top pesticide sites and were replaced by lettuce and flowers. WORKPLACE PESTICIDE RELATED ILLNESSES AND INJURIES INCREASE What is the measure? The number of workplace pesticide related illnesses and injuries experienced in the Santa Barbara County. This measure includes antimicrobial agents such as chlorine. Why is it important? Many factors influence our health, including environmental factors. Workplace pesticide related illnesses are one of those that are regularly tracked. How are we doing? The number of reported illnesses related to pesticides has typically remained under 20 cases a year, with three major exceptions. The past two years saw a dramatic increase in the number of workplace pesticide related illnesses. From 2012 to 2013, there was over a 200 percent increase in the number of pesticide related illnesses. While 2014’s numbers have decreased to 47 cases, they are still much higher than the typical number of cases in prior years. ENERGY USE DECREASES What is the measure? The amount of electricity consumed by the Santa Barbara County for commercial, residential, and industrial purposes, measured in gigawatt hours. (One gigawatt hour equals one thousand megawatt hours.) Why is it important? Electric energy is a critical commodity, integrated into every aspect of our lives in our homes and workplaces. However, the production of electricity may have negative environmental impacts through pollution and resource use. How are we doing? Santa Barbara County energy use decreased in 2015, dropping to its lowest consumption levels in over ten years. Mobility MOST WORKERS COMMUTE ALONE BY CAR What is the measure? The respective percentages of Santa Barbara County residents’ means of transport to work. This data is collected by the United States Census in the American Community Survey. Why is it important? Mobility reflects the ability of people to get from one place to another efficiently; consequentially, traffic congestion prevents this from happening. While traffic congestion has many components – including the level of non-commuter automobile use, population, the success of land-use planning, and the ability of infrastructure improvements to adapt to changes – the level of single occupancy vehicle use has a direct impact on overall traffic congestion. How are we doing? The majority of workers choose to commute alone by car. The proportion of these commuters has remained stable over the past five years. MEAN COMMUTE TIME DECLINES MARGINALLY What is the measure? The average amount of time it takes a commuter in Santa Barbara County to travel to work. Why is it important? Commute distances traveled can reveal much about the quality of life and future trends. Changing commute patterns may indicate a greater sensitivity toward housing costs and the economy. As the distance traveled increases, so does pollution, emission levels from automobiles, and traffic congestion. How are we doing? The average commute time in 2014 was 18.4 minutes, which is the lowest average commute time in our data. Over the past ten years, the mean commute time has peaked at 20.4 minutes. BUS RIDERSHIP DECREASING What is the measure? The number of bus trips taken in Santa Barbara on Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) buses. #### Why is it important? {-} Buses are popular means of alternative transportation in Santa Barbara. In many cases, they are the transportation mode of choice for those who cannot afford an automobile or are unable to drive. #### How are we doing? {-} Total bus ridership has declined recently to 7.6 million in 2014, the lowest ridership levels since 2006. Bus ridership levels peaked in 2009 with 8.3 million rides that year. TRAFFIC VOLUMES STABILIZE OVER LAST FIVE YEARS What is the measure? The number of cars per day on the freeway counted at three interchanges in Santa Barbara County. The interchanges are Highway 101 at Fairview, Las Positas, and Sheffield. Why is it important? Highway 101 is a major roadway in Santa Barbara County, carrying local traffic, commuters from outside of the area, tourists, and other traffic. As the major traffic artery in the area, this highway plays an important role in the mobility of local residents. How are we doing? As shown on the graph, traffic volume has stayed relatively stable over the past decade. Las Positas and Sheffield have both seen slight decreases in their traffic volume, even though all three interchanges have not seen much change in volume over the last few years. Resource Use TOTAL WASTE DISPOSED SEES SLIGHT INCREASE What are the measures? The total tons of waste disposed in the Tajiguas, Santa Maria, and Lompoc landfills, as well as the amount of green waste and recycling diverted from the landfills. Why is it important? Waste disposal is a major form of urban pollution. Growing populations cause the total amount of waste to increase. Changes in the local economy, consumer purchasing decisions, and recycling and composting efforts also affect the amount of waste. How are we doing? The total waste disposed in the Santa Maria and Lompoc landfills increased by about two thousand tons each, reaching 90,534 and 37,554 tons respectively. However, the Tajiguas landfill (which serves most of the South Coast) has seen a larger upward tick in total waste disposed, moving from 175,099 tons to 191,598 tons. The total amount of green waste has increased in 2015 from 158 to 160 pounds per capita, whereas the total recyclables diverted decreased from 100 to 96 pounds per capita. California currently has a statewide goal of reducing solid waste by 75 percent by 2020 through recycling, composting, and source reduction. As of last year, recovery percentage for Santa Barbara County is 50 percent. Nature TOTAL BIRD COUNT EXPERIENCES A DECLINE What is the measure? The results of the Audobon Society’s annual Christmas Bird Count for five species. The bird count is designed as a measure of the diversity of bird species, but it can also be used as a rough indicator of how well bird species are thriving. Five common species are reported - the California Quail, the Nuttall’s Woodpecker, the American Crow, the Wrentit, and the Western Meadowlark. All of these species are resident birds, living in different local habitats. Why is it important? Bird populations are an important part of out local ecosystem, and generally reflect its overall health. Changes in the bird count can reflect changes in habitat or other shifts in local environment. How are we doing? For the past decade, the number of Nuttall’s Woodpeckers, Wrentits, and Western Meadowlarks have generally declined. These species have decreased mainly due to the loss of local chapparral and woodlands. However, the number of sightings of American Crows has seen a 36 percent increase from 2005 to 2015. In 2015, Western Meadowlarks sightings fell dramatically from 720 to 376, a 47 percent decline. This decrease is surprising considering the 129 percent increase seen from 2013 to 2014. Similar to the Western Meadowlarks, the number of California Quails also fell by 26 percent moving from 2014 to 2015 after increasing considerably the years before. The sightings of Wrentits and Nuttall’s Woodpecker’s generally stayed the same, although remaining on a downward trend. As most of the species decline, the number of American Crows sightings continues to grow, representing more than half of the total bird count. "],

This data consists of money income – exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains – before payment of personal income taxes, Social Security, union dues, Medicare deductions and the like. It excludes non-cash benefits such as food stamps or health benefits. The data is adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? This is the best measure of income in the context of the standard of living for households because it controls for changes in household size. It measures the ability of families to make necessary and discretionary expenditures on goods and services. How are we doing? The median household income in North County decreased slightly in 2016, falling from $63,887 to $63,694. This was a slight decline that came after a 5 percent increase in household income from 2014 to 2015. South County household income has continued to rise to $78,076, increasing 4.15 percent over the last year. REAL AVERAGE SALARY PER WORKER RISES SLIGHTLY What is the measure? Real Average Salary is computed by summing total wages and salaries paid to all workers in the County, and then dividing by the total number of wage- and salary-earning employees. This is a countywide measure and is adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? While real median family income includes all residents and all sources of income, the real average wage per worker measures wages or salaries only. It is a better indicator of the health of local companies and the economic well-being of workers. How are we doing? The real average salary per worker increased slightly from last year’s level. It rose from $49,488 to $49,907 in 2016. This is a 4.51 percent increase from the average salary in 2009. Job Quality and Quantity GROWTH IN THREE SECTORS What is the measure? Employment in Santa Barbara County, sorted by Industry Grouping in 2010 and 2015. This data was formulated by the UCSB Economic Forecast Project, using California Employment Development Department (EDD) data. Why is it important? Shifts in the type of employment and associated wages can impact the real average worker’s salary and either enhance or constrain career opportunities for the local workforce. How are we doing? Since 2010, Santa Barbara County has experienced significant growth in the information (29 percent), leisure and hospitality (21 percent), and wholesale trade (20 percent) sectors. No sectors have experienced a decrease in employment since 2010. However, the financial activities secotor, which accounts for 3 percent of total employment in 2015, has seen no growth in employment since 2010. AVERAGE SALARIES IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY What is the measure? Average salary by industry in Santa Barbara County is compared for 2010 and 2015. These two snapshots of Santa Barbara County average salary data, sorted by industry, are derived from California Employment Development Department data sources. This measure is inflation-adjusted and presented in 2009 dollars. Why is it important? While a number of factors contribute to quality employment – such as job satisfaction, the quality of the workplace and co-workers – the level of pay is an important aspect of job quality and the easiest to measure. How are we doing? Average salaries in most sectors in Santa Barbara County have been on the rise since 2010. The sectors with the largest growth in average salaries are information (35 percent), agriculture (25 percent), and financial activities (10 percent). The only industry that declined was education and health services (a less than 1 percent loss). JOB AND POPULATION GROWTH RATES VARY What is the measure? These indicators measure the difference between the the job growth rate and the population growth rate for both North County and South Coast. Why is it important? When the rate of job creation exceeds the rate of population growth, with no change in labor force participation, the net result is a reduction in unemployment. Job creation reflects economic expansion and the health of local firms and is a measure of the vitality of the local economy. Job creation and population growth also puts pressure on the housing market and may lead to longer commute, perhaps from outside the region. How are we doing? Job growth trends often mirror population growth trends. While South Coast patterns tend to be somewhat correlated, a large discrepancy in population and employment trends has not been seen in recent years. In 2015, the job growth exceeded population growth. For North County, job growth has exceeded population growth recently. WHOLESALE TRADE SECTOR SEES MOST GROWTH What is the measure? Job growth by industry from 2010 to 2018 in Santa Barbara County. Employment figures are derived from the UCSB Economic Forecast Project using data from the California Employment Development Department. Why is it important? While job creation is generally indicative of a healthy economy, growth can occur in only a few industries while others stagnate or decline. The job growth rate by industry reflects changes in employment patterns over time. It provides some insight into changes in economic diversity in Santa Barbara County. How are we doing? Most industries in Santa Barbara County experienced job growth between the years of 2010 and 2018. The wholesale trade sector showed the most growth (33 percent) in the last eight years. The governement sector has had the least growth in employment since 2010. GOVERNMENT-TO-POPULATION RATIO STABLE What is the measure? The ratio of federal, state, and local government workers per 1,000 Santa Barbara County residents. Why is it important? The public sector plays a central role in our society, providing important services such as police, fire, and environmental protection, education and social services. An increase in the proportion of government workers in the population may be seen by some as negative –signaling higher taxes, a constraining regulatory environment and a cumbersome bureaucracy. For others, the same measurement may indicate an improvement in public services. How are we doing? In 2015, there were approximately 87.4 government workers per 1,000 residents. This data includes employees in the education sector, which represents a large majority of these employment numbers. Housing Affordability SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HAS LEAST AFFORDABLE HOUSING What is the measure? This measure is an estimate of the percentage of households that can afford to own a median-priced home. This index uses data from the California Association of Realtors, and uses a different methodology in estimating affordability. We have chosen to highlight affordability indices between neighboring counties, California, and the United States. Why is it important? Comparing this index with those of other counties, the state, and the nation provides some sense of just how different the Santa Barbara County housing market is from Ventura County, San Luis Obispo County, the state as a whole, and the United States. How are we doing? Almost without exception, Santa Barbara County has had the least affordable housing of the regions shown for the last ten years. Affordability in 2016 has followed this trend with only 20 percent of households able to afford a median-priced home. The 2010 spike up in affordability was a result of the large decline in housing prices just after the Great Recession. RENTAL RATES EXPERIENCE SLOW GROWTH, BUT CONTINUE TO REMAIN HIGH What is the measure? Average apartment rental rates in Goleta Valley, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Santa Barbara City market areas, as well as the South Coast as a whole. Including, the percentages at which rents are increasing based on survey estimates. The values are not adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? Similar to the housing affordability index, the cost of renting apartments is a major component of the cost of living in Santa Barbara County. The percentage change in apartment rental rates can be compared against measures of family income to determine if wages are keeping pace with rising rents. How are we doing? Rental rates throughout the South Coast rose slightly at 0.1 percent from October 2015 to April 2016, which is a sharp decrease from the 2.8 percent growth rate six months before. With the exception of Goleta Valley Market Area, all regions showed an increase in rents from October 2015 to April 2016. However, Goleta Valley Market Area remains with the highest average rental rate at $2005 per month. While most of the average rents in the South Coast are increasing, the year over year growth has slowed significantly from April 2015 to April 2016, respectively. Business Vitality TOTAL AVAILABLE SPACE INCREASES SLIGHTLY AS GROSS LEASE RATES REACH RECORD HIGHS What is the measure? Available space for office, industrial, and retail space. The data are updated twice a year through a survey of all listed properties from conventionally advertised sources, including brokers’ offices. Why is it important? The direction of available commercial space reflects the overall business climate and rate of commercial development. Inadequate space coupled with higher costs of leasing may act as a constraint on economic expansion. How are we doing? In 2016, vacant office space increased to 646,000 square feet after two years of decline, which still remains only 66 percent of 2010 levels. Industrial vacancies decreased 19 percent from the prior year to 212,000 square feet. Retail space available grew slightly to 163,000 square feet, but still follows a declining trend. In 2016, the gross lease rates for each type of space increased. The high demands for office space has alowed the rates to rise to $2.44 per square foot, which is the highest it’s been for the past decade. Similarily, gross lease rates for the industrial and retail space also reached record highs in 2016, at $1.63 and $3.97 per square foot, respectively. "],
["non-profit.html", "Non-Profit", " Non-Profit .column-left{ float: left; width: 50%; text-align: left; } .column-right{ float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right; } Gifts, Grants, and Contributions to Non-Profits Continue to Grow What are the measures? The total amount of gifts, grants, and contributions to non-profit organizations. This data is from the Internal Revenue Service tax reports of organizations, based in Santa Barbara County, that normally have receipts of more than $50,000 per year. There are some small nonprofits that choose not to file that are missed in the data. The data is adjusted for inflation. Why are they important? Non-profit organizations provide important services not always addressed by other sectors of our community, such as attending to the needs of youth, homeless, victims of crime, low income families, the environment, sports, the arts, and much more. How are we doing? In 2014, contributions from private sources were the highest amount for the fifth consecutive year. Government grants rose slightly from 2013 to 2014 after a small decrease a couple years prior. From 2000 to 2014, South Coast non-profit fundraising grew from $384 to $973 million inflation-adjusted dollars, while countywide non-profit fundrasing grew from $424 million to $1.05 billion inflation-adjusted dollars. Most of the non-profit activity was highly concentrated in the South Coast. A break-down of the top eight fundraising cities in the County is below. In 2014, Santa Barbara City non-profits recieved the highest amount of contributions while Montecito non-profits recieved the smallest; even though, they significantly increased their funds from 79,500 to 536,500 dollars. Although, not all the money raised by non-profits is spent in the area, a great deal of it is, to the enormous benefit of the County residents. NON-PROFIT CONTRIBUTIONS SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES What are the measures? Drawn from the IRS data for organizations that recieved more than $50,000 in contributions, this provides a snapshot of the different types of organizations in the County as well as the amount of contributions goes to each sector, expressed as a percentage of the whole. The ‘Contributions to Non-Profits’ pie chart shows the distribution of the $1.05 billion inflation-adjusted dollars discussed on page 22. Why is it important? Combined with the total contributions, gifts, and grants data presented in the last couple of pages, one can get a solid picture of where the contributions go and where they come from. How are we doing? In 2014, Environmental organizations were the smallest percentage of non-profits in Santa Barbara at 8.5 percent, while Human Services made up almost half. In addition, Human Services non-profits recieved the highest amount of government grants, with Education as a close second. Despite the bigger weight on Human Services, the diversity of purposes reflects Santa Barbara’s non-profits commitment to address the community needs in all areas. UNITED WAY OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY What is the measure? The amount of revenue United Way of Santa Barbara County generates through workplace campaigns, grant seeking, bequests, and other activities. Why is it important? Non-profit organizations provide important services not always addressed by other sectors of our community – attending to the needs of the homeless, victims of crime, low-income families, the environment, the arts, and much, much more. United Way provides resources to children, families, and seniors in the Santa Barbara Community, focusing primarily on improving education, health, and financial empowerment. While contributions made to United Way constitute a fraction of total non-profit giving in our community, it is one proxy measure for charitable giving. How are we doing? In the fiscal year of 2016-2017, United Way generated $1,835,409 in total revenue with $1,560,170 coming from contributions and grants. After reaching an all-time high in 2012-2013 of $4,112,841, revenues and contributions have trended down and are now less than half that number in real terms. "],
