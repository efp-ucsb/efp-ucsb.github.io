North County has a larger proportion of their population below the age of 14 compared to the South Coast. The South Coast has a much larger proportion of their population over the age of 55. Household Income Distribution What is the measure? The percent of households falling in certain income ranges for North County, the South Coast, and California in 2018. Why is it important? The overall health of a community depends on the ability of its residents to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. The income distribution breaks down the earnings and allows us to examine the percent of families that can afford a certain quality of life. We can use the income distribution to draw an overview of the economic composition of the community and how it compares to California. How are we doing? The South Coast tends to be wealthier than North County and California, with higher percentages of its residents falling at the upper end of the income distribution range. Past the $100,000 per year mark, we see that North County is consistently higher than both California and South Coast. For both areas of the county, there is a smaller percent of households making less than $15,000 than California as a whole.
