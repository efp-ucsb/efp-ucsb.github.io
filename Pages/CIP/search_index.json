The total amount of gifts, grants, and contributions to non-profit organizations. This data is from the Internal Revenue Service tax reports of organizations, based in Santa Barbara County, that normally have receipts of more than $50,000 per year. There are some small nonprofits that choose not to file that are missed in the data. The data is adjusted for inflation. Why are they important? Non-profit organizations provide important services not always addressed by other sectors of our community, such as attending to the needs of youth, homeless, victims of crime, low income families, the environment, sports, the arts, and much more. How are we doing? In 2014, contributions from private sources were the highest amount for the fifth consecutive year. Government grants rose slightly from 2013 to 2014 after a small decrease a couple years prior. From 2000 to 2014, South Coast non-profit fundraising grew from $384 to $973 million inflation-adjusted dollars, while countywide non-profit fundrasing grew from $424 million to $1.05 billion inflation-adjusted dollars. Most of the non-profit activity was highly concentrated in the South Coast. A break-down of the top eight fundraising cities in the County is below. In 2014, Santa Barbara City non-profits recieved the highest amount of contributions while Montecito non-profits recieved the smallest; even though, they significantly increased their funds from 79,500 to 536,500 dollars. Although, not all the money raised by non-profits is spent in the area, a great deal of it is, to the enormous benefit of the County residents. NON-PROFIT CONTRIBUTIONS SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES What are the measures? Drawn from the IRS data for organizations that recieved more than $50,000 in contributions, this provides a snapshot of the different types of organizations in the County as well as the amount of contributions goes to each sector, expressed as a percentage of the whole. The ‘Contributions to Non-Profits’ pie chart shows the distribution of the $1.05 billion inflation-adjusted dollars discussed on page 22. Why is it important? Combined with the total contributions, gifts, and grants data presented in the last couple of pages, one can get a solid picture of where the contributions go and where they come from. How are we doing? In 2014, Environmental organizations were the smallest percentage of non-profits in Santa Barbara at 8.5 percent, while Human Services made up almost half. In addition, Human Services non-profits recieved the highest amount of government grants, with Education as a close second. Despite the bigger weight on Human Services, the diversity of purposes reflects Santa Barbara’s non-profits commitment to address the community needs in all areas. UNITED WAY OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY What is the measure? The amount of revenue United Way of Santa Barbara County generates through workplace campaigns, grant seeking, bequests, and other activities. Why is it important? Non-profit organizations provide important services not always addressed by other sectors of our community – attending to the needs of the homeless, victims of crime, low-income families, the environment, the arts, and much, much more. United Way provides resources to children, families, and seniors in the Santa Barbara Community, focusing primarily on improving education, health, and financial empowerment. While contributions made to United Way constitute a fraction of total non-profit giving in our community, it is one proxy measure for charitable giving. How are we doing? In the fiscal year of 2016-2017, United Way generated $1,835,409 in total revenue with $1,560,170 coming from contributions and grants. After reaching an all-time high in 2012-2013 of $4,112,841, revenues and contributions have trended down and are now less than half that number in real terms. "]
