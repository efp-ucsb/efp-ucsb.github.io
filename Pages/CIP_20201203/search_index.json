North County has a larger proportion of their population below the age of 14 compared to the South Coast. The South Coast has a much larger proportion of their population over the age of 55. Household Income Distribution What is the measure? The percent of households falling in certain income ranges for North County, the South Coast, and California in 2018. Why is it important? The overall health of a community depends on the ability of its residents to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. The income distribution breaks down the earnings and allows us to examine the percent of families that can afford a certain quality of life. We can use the income distribution to draw an overview of the economic composition of the community and how it compares to California. How are we doing? The South Coast tends to be wealthier than North County and California, with higher percentages of its residents falling at the upper end of the income distribution range. Past the $100,000 per year mark, we see that North County is consistently higher than both California and South Coast. For both areas of the county, there is a smaller percent of households making less than $15,000 than California as a whole. Neighborhood and Community Well-Being Crime Rates Remain Low What are the measures? These crime rates measure the number of property and violent crimes per 1,000 people in North County and in the South Coast. Violent crimes include homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, whereas property crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other theft. Why are the measures important? Crime affects the level of real and perceived safety, which greatly impacts the health of neighborhoods. In some cases, the reality and perception of safety can be different. How are we doing? Violent crimes have fallen in both North County and the South Coast over the last several years. In 2017, violent crime was low at 2.24 crimes per 1,000 people for the South Coast, which represents a 0.451 percent increase over 2016. On the other hand, there was a 2.73 percent decrease in violent crime in North County over the past year, with 3.21 crimes per 1,000 inhabitants. Property crime rates have fallen in both North County, with an 8 percent decrease, and in the South Coast, with a 14 percent decrease. Juvenile Felony Arrests Remain Lowest in Decade What is the measure? The number of juvenile felony arrests in Santa Barbara County per 1,000 adolescents, including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and larceny. Why is it important? The rate of juvenile crime not only impacts our communityb of how safe our community may be in the future. In addition, it reflects the effectiveness of intervention programs focused at teens and pre-teens. How are we doing? Juvenile arrests are at an all time low of 6.4 arrests per 1,000 adolescents, which is a 48.4 percent decrease over the past decade. However,over the past few years, the decrease has slowed and the rate is leveling out. Child Maltreatment Allegations Remain Constant What is the measure? The number of children in Santa Barbara County with at least one child maltreatment allegation, which includes sexual, emotional, and physical abuse, severe and general neglect, exploitation, caretaker absence/incapacity, and at risk allegations. If a child has more than one allegation in different categories, the child is only counted once. Why is it important? This is the best measure summarizing all types of child abuse and neglect encountered within the community. The consequence of child abuse impacts not only the child but on support services and school systems as well. How are we doing? In 2015, Santa Barbara County surpassed its previous peak in child maltreatment allegations with 5,533 cases. Child maltreatment allegations have consistently been on the rise since 2010. Individual and Family Well-Being Domestic Violence Call Rate Decreases Slightly What is the measure? The domestic violence call rate is the number of 911 calls reported to police and sheriff departments in Santa Barbara County regarding domestic violence, including violence to children. This measure includes attacks with guns, knives, heavy objects, hands, fists, and feet. Why is it important? Domestic violence has tragic implications for the individual health and wellbeing of adults and children, and directly impacts the families to which they belong. Domestic violence may also be an indicator of the relative health of a community as a whole. How are we doing? The domestic violence call rate decreased marginally by 0.036 calls for South Coast and increased by 0.38 calls for the North County per 1,000 people in the past year. Both North County and South Coast experienced their lowest rate in 2008 at 3.9 and 1.4 calls per 1,000 people, respectively. This could indicate either a low in domestic violence or a reluctance to report in uncertain economic times. Weapon-Related Domestic Violence Call Rate What is the measure? This statistic measures the rate of calls to 911 in Santa Barbara County in which domestic violence with a weapon is reported. Weapons include guns, knives, heavy objects, hands, fists, and feet. This specifically excludes verbal abuse. How are we doing? For the South Coast, the rate of weapon-related domestic violence calls to 911 have fluctuated between a high of 2.76 calls per 1,000 people in 2005 and a low of 0.19 calls per 1000 in 2016. In North County, the year 2017 represented the highest rate of weapon-related calls at 3.65 per 1000, and 2009 represented the lowest at 2.4 calls. For the South Coast, the number of cases has remained fairly stable since 2011. Rape Crime Rates Increase What is the measure? The number of reported rapes, calculated as the rate per 1,000 people. Why is it important? Rape crimes play a very significant role in shaping the community’s sense of “being safe.” Because these crimes violate one’s personal rights, these crimes are both personally devastating and emotionally tolling on a community. How are we doing? For the past several years, there has been a fair amount of variance in the rape crime rate for both North County and the South Coast. The South Coast reached its highest rate at 0.697 incidents per 1,000 people in 2016 and has decreased to 0.53. North County reached its highest rate in the last year, with 0.553 incidents per 1,000 people. Births to Teenage Mothers Declining What is the measure? The number of children born to women between the ages of 15-19 per 1,000 women in that age range. Why is it important? Births to teens represent a growing social concern. While children of teenage mothers can be happy and healthy, they are at a higher risk of suffering health problems than other children. Teenage mothers may face great challenges in raising children because of the time conflicts with attending school, lack of experience with child care, and the lack of income necessary to provide for a child. How are we doing? The percentage of teen births in the Santa Barbara County reached its lowest point in 2016, reaching a rate of only 16.8 births per 1,000 teens. Mothers Receiving Inadequate Prenatal Care Drops What is the measure? The percentage of total births in the Santa Barbara County in which the mother does not receive any prenatal care within the first three months of pregnancy. Why is it important? The level of prenatal care is not only a leading indicator of successful pregnancies, but also a predictor of a childb health later in life. How are we doing? In the past ten years, inadequate prenatal care has fluctuated reaching a peak of 28.4 percent in 2009. However, the percentage of mothers receiving inadequate prenatal care has decreased since then, hovering around 23.2 percent. In 2014, it dropped to 22.3 percent. Infant Mortality Rates Remain Low What is the measure? The number of deaths of infants one year and under per 1,000 live births in Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? In addition to the emotional damage caused to parents, high infant mortality rates are often an indication of a motherb abnormalities, low birthweight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or problems related to complications of pregnancies. How are we doing? Infant mortality rates decreased sharply from 2011 to 2012, falling from 4.8 to 2.9 deaths per 1,000 live births. The rate in 2013 remained stable at 2.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, decreasing only slightly from 2012 rate. Elementary School Lunch Eligibility What is the measure? This program provides federally sponsored, free, or subsidized school lunch programs in local public elementary schools. Because families must demonstrate financial need in order to participate, this measure reflects the percentage of children living in families with low incomes. Currently eligible students come from households with incomes at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level. Why is it important? In many ways, children are the most sensitive to any negative forces in our families and communities. While it is true that many children from poorer families benefit from a solid family structure and do very well in society, financial strain is often seen as having a negative impact on a child’s opportunities. At a minimum, children from poorer families often have diminished access to education and health care. How are we doing? While school lunch participation generally increased throughout the late 2000s to early 2010s, recently the percentage of students eligible for the program has stagnated across the South Coast. When comparing the South Coast to North County and statewide levels, the South Coast has less participation in these programs. North County, however, has slightly more eligible students than the statewide average. Eligibility is at an all time high for North, South, and California. Poverty in the County Poverty Status of Families What is the measure? A breakdown of the composition of families with incomes at, above, and below poverty in Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? Understanding the composition of families living in poverty allows us to see which part of the population is suffering the most from poor wages. How are we doing? Most families with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level are families without children. 55 percent of the 12,369 households living in poverty in North County are families without children. 59 percent of the 4,666 households living in poverty in South Coast are families without children. Numbers of Meals Served Increases, 35 Percent of Those Served are Under 18 What is the measure? The amount of food distributed by Santa Barbara County Foodbank, the number of people served in Santa Barbara County food kitchens, and the age of those served in 2016. Why are they important? People use food kitchens when they cannot afford to buy enough food for themselves or their families, and good nutrition is an essential part of staying healthy. The number of people using food banks is often indicative of the number of people living at or below the poverty level within a community. How are we doing? The pounds of food distributed and number of meals served in Santa Barbara County increased by 3 percent from 2014 to 2015, whereas the number of people served also increased by 3 percent from 146,198 to 150,409 people. This indicates that food contributions are rising at the same pace as the amount of people needing to be fed. Of the 150,409 people served in Santa Barbara County, 35 percent of them were under the age of 18. A considerable number of young people in Santa Barbara County live in families that do not earn enough money to provide adequate nutrition for their children. Number of Homeless Using Health Care Program Follows Decreasing Trend What is the measure? The number of users of the Health Care for the Homeless program broken down by gender. The Health Care for the Homeless program is federally funded and allows homeless people to receive medical attention. Why is it important? The overall health of a community depends on the physical and mental health of all of its members. Providing health care for the homeless permits more people in the community to remain in good health. How are we doing? The number of homeless people using the program has continued its downward trend since 2011. In 2015, 2,170 men and 1,391 women utilized this federal program, compared to 3,173 men and 1860 women in 2011. Given the challenges of attempting to measure the homeless and transient population, it is difficult to determine if these decreases reflect a smaller number of homeless people taking advantage of the program, or a decrease in the homeless population being served. Education SAT Scores Continue Downward Trend What is the measure? The Standard Aptitude Test (SAT) is designed to measure verbal, mathematical, and reading aptitude and is used as part of the admissions process at most universities. The score is also used as a benchmark in assessing and comparing the performance of secondary schools. The maximum possible score from these years is 2400. In 2016, the test format was changed, and cannot be compared to previous years. Why is it important? Whether high school students are prepared to enter the workforce or continue their education is key to their future opportunities and success. The general preparedness of our high school students has a great impact on our economy and community as a whole. How are we doing? The scores for South Coast high schools continue to lead benchmark data for the County and state by a large margin. The North County scores remain slightly below California scores. The most recent data shows a continued trend of falling SAT scores across all three areas. Higher Percentage of Students Take the SAT What is the measure? The percentage of high school seniors taking the SAT. Why is it important? Taking the SAT exam is an indication that a student hopes to attend a four-year college or university. Consequently, the percentage of students taking the SAT is a measure of how successfully the schools have prepared their students and of student aspirations. How are we doing? Despite a small drop in percentages for South Coast in the last year, it was offset by a rise in North County, and the trend of high school seniors taking the SAT appears to be rising across all three locations. However, it is important to note that less than half of high school students take the SAT, denoting those with aspirations for a college or university degree directly after high school. South Coast Outscores the North Coast on CAASPP What are the measures? The California Assessment of Student Performance Progress (CAASPP) is a newer program implemented to replace the Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) exam system. Designed to measure understanding of mathematical and verbal skills, the test is given to public school students in the County and then compared to other students in California. Why is it important? Similar to the SAT, these tests are designed to measure the preparedness and general education level of local students. The scores are also used as a benchmark in assessing and comparing the performance of schools. How are we doing? All six elementary school districts in the South Coast outperform the County in the percent of students that have met or exceeded the CAASPP standard for both English and Math. However, the statewide test results surpass those of the Santa Barbara and Carpinteria school districts. In North County, only the Ballard, Buellton, Los Olivos, and Solvang school districts score better than the California average. Book and Magazine Circulation Surpasses One Million What are the measures? We are tracking three measures by sub-area in Santa Barbara County: the volume of book and magazine circulation, the monthly average of library hours, and the volume of library audio-visual circulation. Why are they important? Public libraries provide supplemental educational resources for children, continuing education opportunities for adults, and an enhancement of the cultural quality of life. How are we doing? This data shows active use of library service throughout the Santa Barbara County. The average library hours has remained unchanged over the past three years. Meanwhile, book and magazine circulation surpassed one million books, and audio-visual circulation was nearly half a million units. Citizen Engagement Voter Registration and Turnout Increases What are the measures? These graphs measure the percent of the eligible population that is registered to vote and the percent of registered voters who voted in past elections in Santa Barbara County. Why are they important? Voter registration and turnout measure the most basic forms of civic participation, and are surrogate measures for the level of interest residents have in community affairs. Broad-based citizen involvement not only improves the accountability of government, but also creates a critical fabric of support for all our institutions. How are we doing? Voter registration increased in the 2016 Presidential Election, reaching 76.8 percent of eligible voters. This is the highest voter registration percentage in recent election cycles since 2004, where voter registration was 79.5 percent. The voter turnout for the presidential election also increased from 80.3 percent in 2012 to 81.7 percent in 2016. However, voter turnout in midterm elections has been decreasing, reaching its lowest levels of recent years in 2014. Cultural Resources Performing Arts Ticket Sales Increase as Number of Shows Exhibit a Slight Decline What is the measure? The total ticket sales and number of performances at the Santa Barbara Bowl, the Lobero Theater, and UCSB Arts and Lectures. Why is it important? The arts are a critical part of the community fabric that offers a place where residents and visitors alike can come together, and enjoy the artistic expression of the human spirit. How are we doing? Total tickets sales for all three venues in 2015 was 232,168 dispalying an 11 percent increase from 2014; at the same time, the total number of shows declined 10%. Santa Barbara Bowl experienced a 23 percent spike in ticket sales, along with an increase of 6 events. Lobero Theater saw a decline of 7% in ticket sales corresponding with a 20 percent decrease of events throughout 2015. Similiarly, UCSB Arts and Lectures displayed a loss in ticket sales, but with roughly the same amount of events from the previous year. The 2017 and 2018 ticket sales and shows were impacted by the Thomas Fire and resulting debris flow leading to cancellations. "]]
