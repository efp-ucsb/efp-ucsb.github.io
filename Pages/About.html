                        The Economic Forecast Project was established in 1981 by the Department of Economics at UC Santa Barbara to provide the community with information on economic, demographic, real estate, and regional business trends in the Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura County areas. While the tri-county area remains part of the regional analysis, the EFP only maintains a board of directors for North and South Santa Barbara county. The primary research activity is the collection and verification of statistical data to enhance the decisions made by business as well as public policy officials. The UCSB Economic Forecast Project monitors the status of the economy and provides clear, comprehensive, independent and bipartisan analysis of economic trends in the local area. The EFP relies on the latest dependable data sources including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic Development Department of California, California Department of Finance as well as many local data sources.

                        The Forecast Project is a research program supported by community sponsors and the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor. Oversight is provided by two Advisory Boards of Directors, one representing the business community of South Santa Barbara County and one representing the business community of North Santa Barbara County.

                            The Economic Forecast Project is a University of California, Santa Barbara community-sponsored research department.  Our mission is to provide reliable economic, demographic, health, and environmental data and analysis to our community of citizens, government, business, non-profit, and other users.  To this end, the EFP maintains extensive databases of Santa Barbara County and the Central Coast. Our research is presented to local communities via the internet, publications, and events held across the Santa Barbara region throughout the year. We strive to present our work in the most accurate, coherent, and detailed manner possible. We encourage feedback to help understand the needs of our community.
