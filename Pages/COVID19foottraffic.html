                      As a result of COVID-19, the daily activities of  people
                      across the United States have been fundamentally changed.
                      Using anonymized location data from  <a href
                      ="https://www.safegraph.com/">SafeGraph</a>,  I am able
                      to visualize the trends in the places that people are
                      visiting in the city of Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is known
                      for being a year round tourist destination and has many
                      hotels, motels (including the original Motel 6),  museums,
                      parks, and other tourist destinations.  Looking at the
                      following figure, we can see that beginning in March 2020 the
                      number of visits per week in three categories measuring
                      Tourism, Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation saw large
                      declines. The Nature Parks and Other Similar Institutions
                      category includes many local parks and beaches as well as the
                      Santa Barbara Zoo and MOXI, The Wolf Museum of Exploration +
                      Innovation.  Interestingly, nature parks saw a small spike in
                      the week following the statewide shelter-in-place order on
                      March 19th as many people wished to return outdoors after a
                      week inside. In fact, Elings Park and Shoreline Park two of
                      the most popular parks in Santa Barbara both saw spikes in
                      foot traffic the week of March 30th while the Zoo and Museums
                      remained closed.

                    In addition to visiting the beaches and parks in Santa
                    Barbara, many people come to Santa Barbara to visit the
                    many wine tasting rooms and microbreweries.  Breweries,
                    wineries, and beer, wine, and liquor stores have all seen
                    large declines in foot traffic. However, this impacts the
                    county of Santa Barbara much more than the city of Santa
                    Barbara.  Comparing the following two graphs, the large
                    decline in visits to wineries is much more apparent in the
                    graph on the right that shows trends for all of Santa
                    Barbara county.

                    The changes in locations that people are visiting can be
                    visualized by matching the data from SafeGraph to census
                    blocks. Map areas without shading are census blocks with no
                    registered points of interest or with zero visitors in
                    either the month of February or March.  Some outdoor areas
                    actually experienced increases in the number of visitors in
                    March. Some of the areas that saw the largest increase in
                    visitors in March were areas around More Mesa, San Miguel
                    Open Space, and residential areas on The Mesa. Large areas
                    also saw decreases including Isla Vista, State Street,
                    University of California Santa, Santa Barbara City College,
                    and the Funk Zone.

                    Food and Health Supplement stores saw an increase in foot
                    traffic in early March, with GNC being a large proportion
                    of that increase, before seeing a decline in late March.
                    Movie theaters began experiencing a decline even before
                    closures due to the shelter-in-place, with decreased foot
                    traffic beginning in early March.  Looking to some of the
                    brands in Santa Barbara with the most foot traffic, Costco
                    had a spike in March just previous to the shelter-in-place
                    order as people began to stock up on essentials, while The
                    Home Depot saw a spike in the two weeks following the
                    stay-at-home order.

                    Looking further into the Supermarkets and Other Grocery
                    Store foot traffic, an interesting feature emerges.  Whole

                    before a sharp decline in early March, while all other
                    grocery stores saw modest spikes in early March before
                    experiencing declines in late March and early April.
