                        <h2>Foot Traffic</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                      As a result of COVID-19, the daily activities of  people across the United States have been fundamentally changed. Using anonymized location data from  <a href ="https://www.safegraph.com/">SafeGraph</a>,  I am able to visualize the trends in the places that people are visiting in the city of Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is known for being a year round tourist destination and has many hotels, motels (including the original Motel 6),  museums, parks, and other tourist destinations.
                      Looking at the following figure, we can see that beginning in March 2020 the number of visits per week in three categories measuring Tourism, Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation saw large declines. The Nature Parks and Other Similar Institutions category includes many local parks and beaches as well as the Santa Barbara Zoo and MOXI, The Wolf Museum of Exploration + Innovation.
                      Interestingly, nature parks saw a small spike in the week following the statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19th as many people wished to return outdoors after a week inside. In fact, Elings Park and Shoreline Park two of the most popular parks in Santa Barbara both saw spikes in foot traffic the week of March 30th while the Zoo and Museums remained closed.
                    </p>

                    <p class="Text" align = "justify">
                    In addition to visiting the beaches and parks in Santa Barbara, many people come to Santa Barbara to visit the many wine tasting rooms and microbreweries.  Breweries, wineries, and beer, wine, and liquor stores have all seen large declines in foot traffic. However, this impacts the county of Santa Barbara much more than the city of Santa Barbara.  Comparing the following two graphs, the large decline in visits to wineries is much more apparent in the graph on the right that shows trends for all of Santa Barbara county.

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    The changes in locations that people are visiting can be visualized by matching the data from SafeGraph to census blocks. Map areas without shading are census blocks with no registered points of interest or with zero visitors in either the month of February or March.  Some outdoor areas actually experienced increases in the number of visitors in March. Some of the areas that saw the largest increase in visitors in March were areas around More Mesa, San Miguel Open Space, and residential areas on The Mesa. Large areas also saw decreases including Isla Vista, State Street, University of California Santa, Santa Barbara City College, and the Funk Zone.

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    Food and Health Supplement stores saw an increase in foot traffic in early March, with GNC being a large proportion of that increase, before seeing a decline in late March. Movie theaters began experiencing a decline even before closures due to the shelter-in-place, with decreased foot traffic beginning in early March.  Looking to some of the brands in Santa Barbara with the most foot traffic, Costco had a spike in March just previous to the shelter-in-place order as people began to stock up on essentials, while The Home Depot saw a spike in the two weeks following the stay-at-home order.

                    Looking further into the Supermarkets and Other Grocery Store foot traffic, an interesting feature emerges.  Whole Food's saw a very large spike in foot traffic in February before a sharp decline in early March, while all other grocery stores saw modest spikes in early March before experiencing declines in late March and early April.

                    Restaurants across all types of service and food types saw a large decline in foot traffic in March and April. It appears that Mexican Food and Coffee Shops saw the less decline compared to Chinese Food, Pizza, and Sandwiches but all restaurants face large declines.

                    The long term effects of COVID-19 and the populations
                    affected are still not yet fully understood.  Despite the
                    level of uncertainty still surrounding this virus, we do
                    know two things: 1) individuals with comorbidities, i.e.
                    preexisting medical conditions, are most at risk and 2)
                    social distancing works. This is evident in a <a href =
                        "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm">March
                        26 report</a> released by the Center for Disease
                        Control (CDC) and a <a href =
                            "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187">2007
                            study of nonpharmaceutical interventions implented
                            during the 1918-1919 pandemic</a>. The corollary to
                        these two facts is that the elderly who tend to have
                        weaker immune systems or existing medical conditions
                        and those who cannot effectively social distance are
                        particularly susceptible. But how many of these
                        individuals reside in Santa Barbara County?  Moreover,
                        where in Santa Barbara County are they?

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    The age distribution of Santa Barbara County is shown in
                    the table below. Evidently, the age cohort mix of Santa
                    Barbara County residents has remained largely unchanged
                    over the past 5 years. The estimated median age of
                    inidivuals in the county is roughly 34 years of age,
                    roughly four years below that of the United States
                    according to <a
                        href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/median-age-does-not-tell-the-whole-story.html">recent
                        estimates
                        from the Cencus Bureau</a>. Still, Santa Barbara County
                    has a large number of at risk persons. In fact, those aged
                    65+ amke up 15.6% of our population. <a

                    Age is not the only concern. The population density, and in
                    particular the number of persons per household, of Santa
                    Barbara County is also key to understanding how any viral
                    outbreak including COVID-19 is likely to affect our
                    communities. Even with strict adherence to stay-at-home
                    orders, it may be difficult for some in our community to
                    effectively avoid interpersonal contact. If, for example, a
                    household consists of only two individuals, then each
                    household member only need be wary of one additional
                    person's health.  If instead the household consists of four
                    individuals, then each member need be wary of three
                    additional person's actions and/or health. A potential
                    consequence of a high number of persons per household is
                    that viruses have a greater potential to spread the more
                    each member of the household leaves to shop, go to work,
                    etc.

                    The graph below displays the distribution of household size

                    Santa Barbara County have a high number one and two person
                    households, North County has substantially more high

                    than four persons make up 22.0% of households in North
                    County whereas they make up only 11.6% of households in
                    South County. Of particular note is the relatively high
                    number of 7+ person households in North County.

                    Related to the above concerns, is the fact that low income
                    indivduals are likely to be impacted more substantially
                    than other populations, both directly due to health
                    concerns and indirectly due to things like hoarding. It is
                    well known that the impoverished tend to have worse health
                    outcomes than high income individuals. <a href =

                    to The Office of Disease and Health Promotion</a>, those with
                    low socioeconomic status, i.e. income level, education, and
                    occupational status, are more likely to experience heart disease,
                    diabetes, have higher rates of disability, and higher mortality
                    rates. Moreover, financially constrained individuals are
                    substantially more limited with respect to what types of groceries
                    they can afford. Additionally, those who rely <a href =

                    benefits</a> may more limited with respect to food options: they cannot
                    purchase prepared food if the grocery store shelves are
                    empty. These concerns are particularly important given the
                    extent to which grocery store stocks have been strained
                    over the past several weeks.

                    The graph below shows the distribution of household income
                    in North and South County. It also displays in red the
                    income groups for which all members are below the <a href =

                    areas.  Both regions have roughly the same number of impoverished

                    significantly fewer high income households relative to South

                    In the media there has been a lot of discussion about the
                    effects of COVID-19 on the US economy. Regarding the
                    effects on employment,
                    <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-job-losses-federal-report-20200403-cut4xnhiffeinkfbpaxuaxgj2m-story.html">Christopher Rugaber of the Chicago Tribune</a>
                    reports that some economists predict that the unemployment
                    rate (previously sitting at a half-century low of 3.5%) may
                    reach above 15%.
                    <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html">Jeff Cox of CNBC</a>
                    reports of a more dire outlook from
                    <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate">St. Louis Fed</a>
                    projections that suggest this slowdown could cost 47
                    million jobs and lead to jobless rates around 32%. What do
                    these numbers mean for Santa Barbara, and what do they mean
                    for the Tricounty area more generally?

                    <p class="Text" align = "justify">
                    Before we pull out our crystal ball and try to predict
                    the future, what do the data tell us right now? There
                    are a few places to start. The gold standard
                    unemployment numbers that (virtually) everyone uses
                    are released by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
                    on the first Friday of each month. These releases are
                    for the aggregate US economy and are preliminary
                    estimates of <em>last month's</em> unemployment
                    numbers. Any revisions are typically made the following
                    month. Disagregated numbers (by state, MSA, county, and
                    sub-county place) lag these releases. The
                    <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/">Employment Development Department</a>
                    publishes the numbers for California (typically) on the
                    third Friday of each month. EFP analyzes this data and
                    publishes a snapshot overview in our monthly
                    <a href="https://efp.ucsb.edu/Pages/EmploymentUpdate.html">Employment Update</a>.
                    Another important source of data comes from the
                    <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp">Department of Labor's
                        Office of Unemployment Insurance</a>. They report
                    state-level numbers of new (initial) UI claims,
                    continuing claims, and information regarding who is
                    covered by the program. These data are weekly and
                    reported by the "file week end date" (FWED). While it
                    is easy to verify a new claim, backing out who is
                    remaining on unemployment insurance takes more time.
                    This means that there is a one-week lag in FWED initial
                    and continued claims. Below we plot the most recent 5
                    weeks of initial claims along with the level of
                    continued claims for California.

                    Now let's dive into the data a bit and, perhaps,
                    demystify how some of the above projections are
                    obtained, we have constructed estimates of projected
                    job losses for California, Santa Barbara County, San
                    Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County. Endeavoring to
                    be transparent, we detail precisely how these figures
                    are generated. To begin, we make use of aggregate
                    projections by the
                    <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/nearly-20-million-jobs-lost-by-july-due-to-the-coronavirus/">Economic Policy Insitute</a>
                    which predict a private sector contraction of 19.8
                    million jobs by the summer. EPI then disaggregates this
                    national figure by state; we follow a similar procedure
                    to uncover county-level numbers.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    We utilize two separate approaches to come up with the
                    loss figures reported below. We dub these the "Private
                    share" and "Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail share"
                    approaches. Briefly, the former assumes that all
                    projected job losses are uniformly distributed accross
                    industries (weighted by their share of total private
                    employment, of course). That is, if there were two
                    industries of equal size, IND1 and IND2, one half of
                    all losses would be predicted to come from each. The
                    second approach, in contrast, assumes that all job
                    losses are concentrated in the Leisure, Hospitality,
                    and Retail sectors. Put differently, it assumes all
                    other industries are unaffected. Clearly both of these
                    extremes are incorrect: while we may expect the LHR
                    sector to be more exposed, we know that there will be
                    general equilibrium effects elsewhere. Indeed, the
                    "truth" is likely somewhere in the middle. As such, we
                    weight both models equally and think of the results as
                    a reasonably conservative estimate of projected job
                    losses. Quantitative results are largely inelastic to
                    changes in the weight scheme. Further, one must keep in
                    mind that these "conservative estimates" are <em>given</em>
                    the aggregate prediction we use.

                    For reference, we also report the baseline (not
                    seasonally adjusted) employment level for the various
                    regions and sectors. Finally, we translate these raw
                    losses into unemployment rate figures for Santa
                    Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Using
                    numbers from the reference month, we calculate the
                    effect on the unemployment rate if 0 to 50,000
                    additional jobs are lost. Technically this assumes that
                    all lost jobs are by those who live in-county, but this
                    assumption is likely unimportant quantitatively. In the
                    graph below we see that as more individuals lose jobs,
                    the higher is the associated unemployment rate. At 0
                    job losses--where each line crosses the y-axis--we
                    recover the reference month's unemployment rate (i.e.
                    the rate we have most recently observed). The
                    differences in the slopes of each line reflect
                    differences in the base population.  For example, a
                    loss of 50,000 jobs in Ventura would indeed be painful,
                    but would be devastating to San Luis Obispo county. The
                    dotted lines indicate where our numbers above fall into
                    this graph.
