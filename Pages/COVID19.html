                        In the media there has been a lot of discussion about the effects of
                        COVID-19 on the US economy. Regarding the
                        effects on employment,
                        <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-job-losses-federal-report-20200403-cut4xnhiffeinkfbpaxuaxgj2m-story.html">Christopher Rugaber of the Chicago Tribune</a>
                        reports that some economists predict that the
                        unemployment rate (previously sitting at a half-century
                        low of 3.5%) may reach above 15%.
                        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html">Jeff Cox of CNBC</a>
                        reports of a more dire outlook from St. Louis Fed
                        projections that suggest this slowdown could cost 47
                        million jobs and lead to jobless rates around 32%. What
                        do these numbers mean for Santa Barbara, and what do
                        they mean for the Tricounty area more generally?
                        </p>

                        Before we pull out our crystal ball to try to predict
                        the future, what do the data tell us right now? There
                        are a few places to start. The gold standard
                        unemployment numbers that (virtually) everyone uses
                        are released by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
                        on the first Friday of each month. These releases are
                        for the aggregate US economy and are preliminary
                        estimates of <em>last month's</em> unemployment
                        numbers. Any revisions are typically made the following
                        month. Disagregated numbers (by state, MSA, county, and
                        sub-county place) lag these releases. The
                        <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/">Employment Development Department</a>
                        publishes the numbers for California (typically) on the
                        third Friday of each month. EFP analyzes this data and
                        publishes a snapshot overview in our monthly
                        <a href="https://efp.ucsb.edu/Pages/EmploymentUpdate.html">Employment Update</a>.
                        Another important source of data comes from the
                        <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp">Department of Labor's
                        Office of Unemployment Insurance</a>. They report
                        state-level numbers of new (initial) UI claims,
                        continuing claims, and information regarding who is
                        covered by the program. These data are weekly and
                        reported by the "file week end date" (FWED). This date
                        reflects the previous week's end. For example, if the
                        FWED was January 20th, the claims reported would be for
                        those made between January 6th and January 13th. This
                        is important to keep in mind when thinking about the
                        week-by-week flows into unemployment. Below we plot the
                        most recent 5 weeks of initial claims along with the
                        level of continued claims for California.

                        Now let's dive into the data a bit and, perhaps,
                        demystify how some of the above projections are
                        obtained, we have constructed estimates of projected
                        job losses for California, Santa Barbara County, San
                        Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County. Endeavoring to
                        be transparent, we detail precisely how these figures
                        are generated. To begin, we make use of aggregate
                        projections by the
                        <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/nearly-20-million-jobs-lost-by-july-due-to-the-coronavirus/">Economic Policy Insitute</a>
                        which predict a private sector contraction of 19.8
                        million jobs by the summer. EPI then disaggregates this
                        national figure by state; we follow a similar procedure
                        to uncover county-level numbers.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "Text" id = "leftAlign">
                        We utilize two separate approaches to come up with the
                        loss figures reported below. We dub these the "Private
                        share" and "Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail share"
                        approaches. Briefly, the former assumes that all
                        projected job losses are uniformly distributed accross
                        industries (weighted by their share of total private
                        employment, of course). That is, if there were two
                        industries of equal size, IND1 and IND2, one half of
                        all losses would be predicted to come from each. The
                        second approach, in contrast, assumes that all job
                        losses are concentrated in the Leisure, Hospitality,
                        and Retail sectors. Put differently, it assumes all
                        other industries are unaffected. Clearly both of these
                        extremes are incorrect: while we may expect the LHR
                        sector to be more exposed, we know that there will be
                        general equilibrium effects elsewhere. Indeed, the
                        "truth" is likely somewhere in the middle. As such, we
                        weight both models equally and think of the results as
                        a reasonably conservative estimate of projected job
                        losses. Quantitative results are largely inelastic to
                        changes in the weight scheme. Further, one must keep in
                        mind that these "conservative estimates" are <em> given</em>
                        the aggregate prediction we use.

                        <div style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src = "../images/COVID19/table_projections_web.png" style="width:70%;" />
                        </div>
                        <br>

                        <p class = "Text" id = "leftAlign">
                        For reference, we also report the baseline (not
                        seasonally adjusted) employment level for the various
                        regions and sectors. Finally, we translate these raw
                        losses into unemployment rate figures for Santa
                        Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Using
                        numbers from the reference month, we calculate the
                        effect on the unemployment rate if 0 to 50,000
                        additional jobs are lost. Technically this assumes that
                        all lost jobs are by those who live in-county, but this
                        assumption is likely unimportant quantitatively. In the
                        graph below we see that as more individuals lose jobs,
                        the higher is the associated unemployment rate. At 0
                        job losses--where each line crosses the y-axis--we
                        recover the reference month's unemployment rate (i.e.
                        the rate we have most recently observed). The
                        differences in the slopes of each line reflect
                        differences in the base population.  For example, a
                        loss of 50,000 jobs in Ventura would indeed be painful,
                        but would be devastating to San Luis Obispo county. The
                        dotted lines indicate where our numbers above fall into
                        this graph.
