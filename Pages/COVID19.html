						   The long term effects of COVID-19 and the populations affected are still not yet fully understood.
						    Despite the level of uncertainty still surrounding this virus, we do know two things:
						   1) individuals with comorbidities, i.e. preexisting medical conditions,
						   are most at risk and 2) social distancing works. This is evident in a <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm">March 26 report</a> released
						   by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and a <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187">2007 study of nonpharmaceutical interventions
						   implented during the 1918-1919 pandemic</a>. The corollary to these two facts is that the elderly
						   who tend to have weaker immune systems or existing medical conditions and those who cannot effectively
						   social distance are particularly susceptible. But how many of these individuals reside in Santa Barbara County?
						   Moreover, where in Santa Barbara County are they?

					   </p>

					   <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
						   The age distribution of Santa Barbara County is shown in the table below. Evidently, the age cohort mix of
						   Santa Barbara County residents has remained largely unchanged over the past 5 years. The estimated median
						   age of inidivuals in the county is roughly 34 years of age, roughly four years below that of the United States
						   according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/median-age-does-not-tell-the-whole-story.html">recent estimates
 					   	   from the Cencus Bureau</a>. Still, Santa Barbara County has a large number of at risk persons. In fact, those aged
						   65+ amke up 15.6% of our population. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html">According to the CDC</a>
						   8 out of 10 deaths reported in the United States have come from this population.
					   </p>

					   </div>
					   <br>

					   <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
						   Age is not the only concern. The population density, and in particular the number of persons
						   per household, of Santa Barbara County is also key to understanding how any viral outbreak including
						   COVID-19 is likely to affect our communities. Even with strict adherence to stay-at-home orders, it may
						   be difficult for some in our community to effectively avoid interpersonal contact. If, for example, a household
						   consists of only two individuals, then each household member only need be wary of one additional person's health.
						   If instead the household consists of four individuals, then each member need be wary of three additional person's
						   actions and/or health. A potential consequence of a high number of persons per household is that viruses have
						   a greater potential to spread the more each member of the household leaves to shop, go to work, etc.
					   </p>

					   <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
						   The graph below displays the distribution of household size for both North and South County. While both regions
						   of Santa Barbara County have a high number one and two person households, North County has substantially more
						   high density households. In fact, households containing more than four persons make up 22.0% of households in North County
						   whereas they make up only 11.6% of households in South County. Of particular note is the relatively high number of
						   7+ person households in North County.
					   </p>

					   </div>
					   <br>

					   <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
						   Related to the above concerns, is the fact that low income indivduals are likely to be impacted more substantially
						   than other populations, both directly due to health concerns and indirectly due to things like hoarding. It is well known
						   that the impoverished tend to have worse health outcomes than high income individuals. <a href = "https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/poverty">According to The Office of Disease and Health Promotion</a>,
						   those with low socioeconomic status, i.e. income level, education, and occupational status, are more likely to experience
						   heart disease, diabetes, have higher rates of disability, and higher mortality rates. Moreover, financially constrained
						   individuals are substantially more limited with respect to what types of groceries they can afford. Additionally, those who rely
						   <a href = "https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19">SNAP benefits</a> may more limited with respect to
						   food options: they cannot purchase prepared food if the grocery store shelves are empty. These concerns are particularly
						   important given the extent to which grocery store stocks have been strained over the past several weeks.
					   </p>

					   <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
						   The graph below shows the distribution of household income in North and South County. It also displays in red the income groups
						   for which all members are below the <a href = "https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines" >federal poverty line</a> for a household consisting of four individuals
						   ($26,200). This cutoff is of course an underestimate of those that are financially constrained in relatively high cost of living areas.
						    Both regions have roughly the same number of impoverished households as defined above. Evidently, however, North County has significantly fewer
							high income households relative to South County, with a much larger dropoff following the most common income group of $50,000-$75,000.

                        In the media there has been a lot of discussion about the effects of
                        COVID-19 on the US economy. Regarding the
                        effects on employment,
                        <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-job-losses-federal-report-20200403-cut4xnhiffeinkfbpaxuaxgj2m-story.html">Christopher Rugaber of the Chicago Tribune</a>
                        reports that some economists predict that the
                        unemployment rate (previously sitting at a half-century
                        low of 3.5%) may reach above 15%.
                        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html">Jeff Cox of CNBC</a>
                        reports of a more dire outlook from St. Louis Fed
                        projections that suggest this slowdown could cost 47
                        million jobs and lead to jobless rates around 32%. What
                        do these numbers mean for Santa Barbara, and what do
                        they mean for the Tricounty area more generally?
                        </p>


                        <p class="Text" align = "justify">
                        Before we pull out our crystal ball and try to predict
                        the future, what do the data tell us right now? There
                        are a few places to start. The gold standard
                        unemployment numbers that (virtually) everyone uses
                        are released by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
                        on the first Friday of each month. These releases are
                        for the aggregate US economy and are preliminary
                        estimates of <em>last month's</em> unemployment
                        numbers. Any revisions are typically made the following
                        month. Disagregated numbers (by state, MSA, county, and
                        sub-county place) lag these releases. The
                        <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/">Employment Development Department</a>
                        publishes the numbers for California (typically) on the
                        third Friday of each month. EFP analyzes this data and
                        publishes a snapshot overview in our monthly
                        <a href="https://efp.ucsb.edu/Pages/EmploymentUpdate.html">Employment Update</a>.
                        Another important source of data comes from the
                        <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp">Department of Labor's
                        Office of Unemployment Insurance</a>. They report
                        state-level numbers of new (initial) UI claims,
                        continuing claims, and information regarding who is
                        covered by the program. These data are weekly and
                        reported by the "file week end date" (FWED). This date
                        reflects the previous week's end. For example, if the
                        FWED was January 20th, the claims reported would be for
                        those made between January 6th and January 13th. This
                        is important to keep in mind when thinking about the
                        week-by-week flows into unemployment. Below we plot the
                        most recent 5 weeks of initial claims along with the
                        level of continued claims for California.

                        Now let's dive into the data a bit and, perhaps,
                        demystify how some of the above projections are
                        obtained, we have constructed estimates of projected
                        job losses for California, Santa Barbara County, San
                        Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County. Endeavoring to
                        be transparent, we detail precisely how these figures
                        are generated. To begin, we make use of aggregate
                        projections by the
                        <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/nearly-20-million-jobs-lost-by-july-due-to-the-coronavirus/">Economic Policy Insitute</a>
                        which predict a private sector contraction of 19.8
                        million jobs by the summer. EPI then disaggregates this
                        national figure by state; we follow a similar procedure
                        to uncover county-level numbers.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                        We utilize two separate approaches to come up with the
                        loss figures reported below. We dub these the "Private
                        share" and "Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail share"
                        approaches. Briefly, the former assumes that all
                        projected job losses are uniformly distributed accross
                        industries (weighted by their share of total private
                        employment, of course). That is, if there were two
                        industries of equal size, IND1 and IND2, one half of
                        all losses would be predicted to come from each. The
                        second approach, in contrast, assumes that all job
                        losses are concentrated in the Leisure, Hospitality,
                        and Retail sectors. Put differently, it assumes all
                        other industries are unaffected. Clearly both of these
                        extremes are incorrect: while we may expect the LHR
                        sector to be more exposed, we know that there will be
                        general equilibrium effects elsewhere. Indeed, the
                        "truth" is likely somewhere in the middle. As such, we
                        weight both models equally and think of the results as
                        a reasonably conservative estimate of projected job
                        losses. Quantitative results are largely inelastic to
                        changes in the weight scheme. Further, one must keep in
                        mind that these "conservative estimates" are <em>given</em>
                        the aggregate prediction we use.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <div style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src = "../images/COVID19/table_projections.png" style="width:70%;" />
                        </div>
                        <br>

                        <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                        For reference, we also report the baseline (not
                        seasonally adjusted) employment level for the various
                        regions and sectors. Finally, we translate these raw
                        losses into unemployment rate figures for Santa
                        Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Using
                        numbers from the reference month, we calculate the
                        effect on the unemployment rate if 0 to 50,000
                        additional jobs are lost. Technically this assumes that
                        all lost jobs are by those who live in-county, but this
                        assumption is likely unimportant quantitatively. In the
                        graph below we see that as more individuals lose jobs,
                        the higher is the associated unemployment rate. At 0
                        job losses--where each line crosses the y-axis--we
                        recover the reference month's unemployment rate (i.e.
                        the rate we have most recently observed). The
                        differences in the slopes of each line reflect
                        differences in the base population.  For example, a
                        loss of 50,000 jobs in Ventura would indeed be painful,
                        but would be devastating to San Luis Obispo county. The
                        dotted lines indicate where our numbers above fall into
                        this graph.
