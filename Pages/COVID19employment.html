                    In the media there has been a lot of discussion about the
                    effects of COVID-19 on the US economy. Regarding the
                    effects on employment,
                    <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-job-losses-federal-report-20200403-cut4xnhiffeinkfbpaxuaxgj2m-story.html">Christopher Rugaber of the Chicago Tribune</a>
                    reports that some economists predict that the unemployment
                    rate (previously sitting at a half-century low of 3.5%) may
                    reach above 15%.
                    <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html">Jeff Cox of CNBC</a>
                    reports of a more dire outlook from
                    <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate">St. Louis Fed</a>
                    projections that suggest this slowdown could cost 47
                    million jobs and lead to jobless rates around 32%. What do
                    these numbers mean for Santa Barbara, and what do they mean
                    for the Tricounty area more generally?
                    </p>


                    <p class="Text" align = "justify">
                    Before we pull out our crystal ball and try to predict
                    the future, what do the data tell us right now? There
                    are a few places to start. The gold standard
                    unemployment numbers that (virtually) everyone uses
                    are released by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
                    on the first Friday of each month. These releases are
                    for the aggregate US economy and are preliminary
                    estimates of <em>last month's</em> unemployment
                    numbers. Any revisions are typically made the following
                    month. Disagregated numbers (by state, MSA, county, and
                    sub-county place) lag these releases. The
                    <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/">Employment Development Department</a>
                    publishes the numbers for California (typically) on the
                    third Friday of each month. EFP analyzes this data and
                    publishes a snapshot overview in our monthly
                    <a href="https://efp.ucsb.edu/Pages/EmploymentUpdate.html">Employment Update</a>.
                    Another important source of data comes from the
                    <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp">Department of Labor's
                        Office of Unemployment Insurance</a>. They report
                    state-level numbers of new (initial) UI claims,
                    continuing claims, and information regarding who is
                    covered by the program. These data are weekly and
                    reported by the "file week end date" (FWED). While it
                    is easy to verify a new claim, backing out who is
                    remaining on unemployment insurance takes more time.
                    This means that there is a one-week lag in FWED initial
                    and continued claims. Below we plot the most recent 5
                    weeks of initial claims along with the level of
                    continued claims for California.

                    Now let's dive into the data a bit and, perhaps,
                    demystify how some of the above projections are
                    obtained, we have constructed estimates of projected
                    job losses for California, Santa Barbara County, San
                    Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County. Endeavoring to
                    be transparent, we detail precisely how these figures
                    are generated. To begin, we make use of aggregate
                    projections by the
                    <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/nearly-20-million-jobs-lost-by-july-due-to-the-coronavirus/">Economic Policy Insitute</a>
                    which predict a private sector contraction of 19.8
                    million jobs by the summer. EPI then disaggregates this
                    national figure by state; we follow a similar procedure
                    to uncover county-level numbers.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    We utilize two separate approaches to come up with the
                    loss figures reported below. We dub these the "Private
                    share" and "Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail share"
                    approaches. Briefly, the former assumes that all
                    projected job losses are uniformly distributed accross
                    industries (weighted by their share of total private
                    employment, of course). That is, if there were two
                    industries of equal size, IND1 and IND2, one half of
                    all losses would be predicted to come from each. The
                    second approach, in contrast, assumes that all job
                    losses are concentrated in the Leisure, Hospitality,
                    and Retail sectors. Put differently, it assumes all
                    other industries are unaffected. Clearly both of these
                    extremes are incorrect: while we may expect the LHR
                    sector to be more exposed, we know that there will be
                    general equilibrium effects elsewhere. Indeed, the
                    "truth" is likely somewhere in the middle. As such, we
                    weight both models equally and think of the results as
                    a reasonably conservative estimate of projected job
                    losses. Quantitative results are largely inelastic to
                    changes in the weight scheme. Further, one must keep in
                    mind that these "conservative estimates" are <em>given</em>
                    the aggregate prediction we use.

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    For reference, we also report the baseline (not
                    seasonally adjusted) employment level for the various
                    regions and sectors. Finally, we translate these raw
                    losses into unemployment rate figures for Santa
                    Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Using
                    numbers from the reference month, we calculate the
                    effect on the unemployment rate if 0 to 50,000
                    additional jobs are lost. Technically this assumes that
                    all lost jobs are by those who live in-county, but this
                    assumption is likely unimportant quantitatively. In the
                    graph below we see that as more individuals lose jobs,
                    the higher is the associated unemployment rate. At 0
                    job losses--where each line crosses the y-axis--we
                    recover the reference month's unemployment rate (i.e.
                    the rate we have most recently observed). The
                    differences in the slopes of each line reflect
                    differences in the base population.  For example, a
                    loss of 50,000 jobs in Ventura would indeed be painful,
                    but would be devastating to San Luis Obispo county. The
                    dotted lines indicate where our numbers above fall into
                    this graph.
