                    The long term effects of COVID-19 and the populations
                    affected are still not yet fully understood.  Despite the
                    level of uncertainty still surrounding this virus, we do
                    know two things: 1) individuals with comorbidities, i.e.
                    preexisting medical conditions, are most at risk and 2)
                    social distancing works. This is evident in a <a href =
                        "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm">March
                        26 report</a> released by the Center for Disease
                        Control (CDC) and a <a href =
                            "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187">2007
                            study of nonpharmaceutical interventions implented
                            during the 1918-1919 pandemic</a>. The corollary to
                        these two facts is that the elderly who tend to have
                        weaker immune systems or existing medical conditions
                        and those who cannot effectively social distance are
                        particularly susceptible. But how many of these
                        individuals reside in Santa Barbara County?  Moreover,
                        where in Santa Barbara County are they?
                    </p>

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    The age distribution of Santa Barbara County is shown in
                    the table below. Evidently, the age cohort mix of Santa
                    Barbara County residents has remained largely unchanged
                    over the past 5 years. The estimated median age of
                    inidivuals in the county is roughly 34 years of age,
                    roughly four years below that of the United States
                    according to <a
                        href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/median-age-does-not-tell-the-whole-story.html">recent
                        estimates
                        from the Cencus Bureau</a>. Still, Santa Barbara County
                    has a large number of at risk persons. In fact, those aged
                    65+ amke up 15.6% of our population. <a
                    href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html">According
                    to the CDC</a>
                    8 out of 10 deaths reported in the United States have come
                    from this population.

                    Age is not the only concern. The population density, and in
                    particular the number of persons per household, of Santa
                    Barbara County is also key to understanding how any viral
                    outbreak including COVID-19 is likely to affect our
                    communities. Even with strict adherence to stay-at-home
                    orders, it may be difficult for some in our community to
                    effectively avoid interpersonal contact. If, for example, a
                    household consists of only two individuals, then each
                    household member only need be wary of one additional
                    person's health.  If instead the household consists of four
                    individuals, then each member need be wary of three
                    additional person's actions and/or health. A potential
                    consequence of a high number of persons per household is
                    that viruses have a greater potential to spread the more
                    each member of the household leaves to shop, go to work,
                    etc.

                    The graph below displays the distribution of household size
                    for both North and South County. While both regions of
                    Santa Barbara County have a high number one and two person
                    households, North County has substantially more high
                    density households. In fact, households containing more
                    than four persons make up 22.0% of households in North
                    County whereas they make up only 11.6% of households in
                    South County. Of particular note is the relatively high
                    number of 7+ person households in North County.

                    Related to the above concerns, is the fact that low income
                    indivduals are likely to be impacted more substantially
                    than other populations, both directly due to health
                    concerns and indirectly due to things like hoarding. It is
                    well known that the impoverished tend to have worse health
                    outcomes than high income individuals. <a href =
                    "https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/poverty">According
                    to The Office of Disease and Health Promotion</a>, those with
                    low socioeconomic status, i.e. income level, education, and
                    occupational status, are more likely to experience heart disease,
                    diabetes, have higher rates of disability, and higher mortality
                    rates. Moreover, financially constrained individuals are
                    substantially more limited with respect to what types of groceries
                    they can afford. Additionally, those who rely <a href =
                    "https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19">SNAP
                    benefits</a> may more limited with respect to food options: they cannot
                    purchase prepared food if the grocery store shelves are
                    empty. These concerns are particularly important given the
                    extent to which grocery store stocks have been strained
                    over the past several weeks.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "Text" align = "justify">
                    The graph below shows the distribution of household income
                    in North and South County. It also displays in red the
                    income groups for which all members are below the <a href =
                    "https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines" >federal poverty
                    line</a> for a household consisting of four individuals
                    ($26,200). This cutoff is of course an underestimate of those that
                    are financially constrained in relatively high cost of living
                    areas.  Both regions have roughly the same number of impoverished
                    households as defined above. Evidently, however, North County has
                    significantly fewer high income households relative to South
                    County, with a much larger dropoff following the most common income
                    group of $50,000-$75,000.
