The data comes from the California Department of Finance and is an estimate of the number of people residing in Santa Barbara County from 2010 to 2023. The estimate is produced summing the population base, births, and net migration, and then subtracting the number of deaths. Why is it important? Population growth rates provide insight into the pace of population change in a given region over time. These rates can have significant implications for various areas, including public policy, economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being. For instance, a high population growth rate may require a corresponding increase in infrastructure, such as housing, transportation, and healthcare, to accommodate the growing population. Alternatively, a declining population growth rate may indicate a shrinking workforce or an aging population, which can have significant economic and social consequences. How are we doing? Santa Barbara County has experienced modest yet sustained population growth. However, Santa Barbara County experienced a dramatic decline in population from 2020 to 2021, resulting in a loss of 10,810 residents (from 448,244 to 437,434). 2023 saw the lowest population level for the county since 2014 at 440,557. The population has yet to return to its previous level, which is consistent with California’s overall trend. Community Well-being Homelessness What is the measure? The data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The measure is an estimate of the number of homeless individuals in Santa Barbara County annually. The measure includes sheltered and unsheltered individuals, along with other demographic factors. HUD defines sheltered individuals as people who are in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, or safe havens. Unsheltered individuals refer to those whose nighttime location is in a public or private area that is not intended for regular sleeping accommodation. This can include streets, vehicles, and parks. Why is it important? Homelessness is a humanitarian concern and can have implications on public health and safety. Individuals experiencing homelessness often lack access to basic necessities and are more vulnerable to health issues due to inadequate shelter and healthcare access. Social issues including crime, substance abuse, and mental illness can also coincide with homelessness. Measuring homeless populations can help allocate adequate funding to resources including affordable housing, healthcare services, and mental health resources which can mitigate the public health risks and social challenges associated with homelessness. How are we doing? In the last decade, overall homelessness in the county reached its peak in 2022, with 595 sheltered and 1,367 unsheltered individuals. In 2023, approximately 0.43% of the total population was homeless, more than double the national average and aligning with California’s average. The number of homeless youth has been declining since 2017, although they still represent nearly 10% of the total homeless population in Santa Barbara County. In 2020, only sheltered individuals were counted, likely due to the pandemic. Poverty Rates What is the measure? Poverty data for Santa Barbara County comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an annual survey providing communities with estimates on various social, economic, and demographic characteristics. Poverty is measured using money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or non-cash benefits; however, unemployment, social security, and other public assistance income are included. Official poverty thresholds are nationwide and are updated for inflation annually. The threshold for individuals under 65 in 2023 was $15,225, while for a family of two adults and two children, it was $29,678. “All families” includes any size family considered below the poverty threshold and is included in the count of “All people” in poverty. Why is it important? Historic poverty data can assess the effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies and inform the county on where to target resources within the community. Detailed data on poverty can identify vulnerable groups while promoting greater overall well-being. Comparing poverty rates to state or national averages can help keep the county accountable and highlight progress made. How are we doing? In 2022, Santa Barbara County had a poverty rate of 13.5%, which is higher than that of San Francisco County, the state of California, and the overall U.S. average. Over time, the county’s poverty rate has been slightly declining from 14.8% in 2018, but it has remained above the California average for all five years displayed. In 2022, 7.3% of families in the county lived below the poverty line, of which less than a quarter received cash public assistance income in the past 12 months. Juvenile Felony Arrests Reach Lowest in Decade What is the measure? The number of juvenile felony arrests in Santa Barbara County per 1,000 adolescents, including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and larceny. Why is it important? The rate of juvenile crime not only impacts our community in the short term through property and violent crime, but also has larger implications at the societal level. Juvenile delinquency is costly both for the minors themselves and the victims of their crimes. How are we doing? The juvenile felony arrest rate has been steadily decreasing since about 2008 and reached a record low in 2020. Despite a small uptick in 2019, juvenile crime overall is declining.

The number of deaths that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2022 is based on the underlying cause of death as coded by the International Classification of Diseases. The data encompasses deaths of Santa Barbara County residents from 2014-2022. It is important to note that the underlying cause of death may not capture the full impact of each cause of death as it does not always take into account all conditions contributing to the death. Why is it important? The data provides insight into the health status of a population and the most significant health challenges that the community faces. Public health officials and policymakers can identify areas where improvements in healthcare, public health interventions, or social determinants of health are needed. How are we doing?

Rate of Births to Teenage Mothers Declining What is the measure? The number of children born to women between the ages of 15-19 per 1,000 women in that age range for Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? Teenage mothers and children are at high risk. Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school and suffer complications during pregnancy and birth. Babies of teenage mothers are more likely to face low birth weight, premature delivery, infant death and health problems post-birth. Children of teenage mothers are also more likely to drop out of high school, be incarcerated, become teenage parents and face unemployment. How are we doing? The teen birth rate has been steadily declining and received its lowest point in 2020, at a rate of 17 births per 1,000 teens.
