[["index.html", "UCSB Economic Forecast Project Dear Residents,", " UCSB Economic Forecast Project Dear Residents, We are pleased to present the 2022 edition of the Santa Barbara Community Indicators Project (SBCIP). This is a revival of the South Coast Community Indicators Project that ran for six editions from 1998 to 2003. The Santa Barbara Community Indicators Project incorporates both North County and the South Coast in its measures, and is designed to give an overall picture of our community’s health and well-being. This project was made possible through the financial support provided by the Hutton-Parker Foundation, the Mosher Foundation, Montecito Bank &amp; Trust, and the Gretler Foundation. The Santa Barbara Community Indicators Project focuses on social, environmental, and economic data within our community. The quality of our lives is a reflection of the balance of social, environmental, and economic conditions. We encourage our community to engage with us to discover ways in which we can continually improve our health, safety and environment. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction What is the Community Indicators Project? The Community Indicators Project is an effort to measure the social, environmental, and economic factors that make up the quality of life in our community. The project consists of the information in this report, additional data provided at our website (www.efp.ucsb.edu), as well as the process of generating the information. Both the product and the process are essential elements of the effort. Our mission is: To involve the Santa Barbara County community in developing and using social, environmental, and economic indicators that will guide decisions toward continually improving our quality of life. Each section contains the measures used to describe an issue, why those measures are useful and how our community is doing with regard to those measures. The data presented throughout this document cover a wide range of topics and, when possible, separates North County from the South Coast. This is done to better delineate the differences even within a relatively small area. These data should help us discover where our resources can be placed to reduce areas of concern. It is our hope that policy makers and our citizenry will use the information here to better our lives and well-being.

The annual population growth rate by county. The data is an estimate of the number of people residing in the county. This estimate is produced adding the population base, births, and net migration, and then subtracting the number of deaths. Why is it important? Population growth rates are important because they provide insight into the pace of population change in a given region over time. These rates can have significant implications for various areas, including public policy, economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being. For instance, a high population growth rate may require a corresponding increase in infrastructure, such as housing, transportation, and healthcare, to accommodate the growing population. Alternatively, a declining population growth rate may indicate a shrinking workforce or an aging population, which can have significant economic and social consequences. How are we doing? Santa Barbara County has experienced modest yet sustained population growth for roughly a decade. However, for the first time in over a decade, Santa Barbara County experienced a 2.4% population decline from 2020 to 2021, resulting in a loss of 10,810 residents (from 448,244 to 437,434). In contrast, the county saw its most significant growth rate in a decade from 2021 to 2022, with a 1.5% increase in population. Despite this growth, the population has yet to return to its previous level, which is consistent with California’s overall trend. Neighborhood and Community Well-Being Crime Rates Across UCs Plummet During Lockdowns What are the measures? The measures are the number of crimes reported on campus that falls under the categories attempted rape, rape, and robbery. Rape and attempted rape crimes represent the number of victims, while robbery crimes represent the number of known incidents. In instances in which multiple crimes occurred, the most serious crime was counted. Why are the measures important? The number of crimes on campus can indicate the nature and scope of criminal activity, which can have implications on the wider community. Comparing UCSB to other campuses can determine areas for improvement and to develop targeted strategies that enhance safety on and off campus. How are we doing? While crime rates across UCs have increased since 2020, UCSB has maintained relatively low crime rates. However, there is still a concern as UCSB has a disproportionately high number of reported rape cases among the UC campuses. In 2017, despite making up only about 11% of the total UC student population, UCSB accounted for over 40% of the reported rape cases. Juvenile Felony Arrests Reach Lowest in Decade What is the measure? The number of juvenile felony arrests in Santa Barbara County per 1,000 adolescents, including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and larceny. Why is it important? The rate of juvenile crime not only impacts our community in the short term through property and violent crime, but also has larger implications at the societal level. Juvenile delinquency is costly both for the minors themselves and the victims of their crimes. How are we doing? The juvenile felony arrest rate has been steadily decreasing since about 2008 and reached a record low in 2020. Despite a small uptick in 2019, juvenile crime overall is declining. Rate of Births to Teenage Mothers Declining What is the measure? The number of children born to women between the ages of 15-19 per 1,000 women in that age range for Santa Barbara County. Why is it important? Teenage mothers and children are at high risk. Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school and suffer complications during pregnancy and birth. Babies of teenage mothers are more likely to face low birth weight, premature delivery, infant death and health problems post-birth. Children of teenage mothers are also more likely to drop out of high school, be incarcerated, become teenage parents and face unemployment. How are we doing? The teen birth rate has been steadily declining and received its lowest point in 2020, at a rate of 17 births per 1,000 teens. Heart Diseases Remain the Leading Cause of Death in Santa Barbara County What is the measure? The number of deaths that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2021 based on the underlying cause of death as coded by the International Classification of Diseases. The data includes deaths to residents of each county (by residence). It is important to note that the underlying cause of death may not capture the full impact of each cause of death as it does not always take into account all conditions contributing to the death. Why is it important? The data provides insight into the health status of a population and the most significant health challenges that the community faces. Public health officials and policymakers can identify areas where improvements in healthcare, public health interventions, or social determinants of health are needed. How are we doing? The leading cause of death in 2021 for Santa Barbara County were heart diseases, referring to conditions including coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Heart diseases have been the leading cause of death worldwide since 1950, with cancer following second. "],["environmental.html", "Environmental Water Quality Land Use Mobility Resource Use Nature Climate", " Environmental .column-left{ float: left; width: 50%; text-align: left; } .column-right{ float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right; } .column-center { width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; } Water Quality Water Quality Violation Days Return to Stable Levels What are the measures? The number of weekly water quality tests that exceed state and federal standards for ecoli, fecal coliform, total coliform, and enterococcus. This data is from the County Ocean Water Monitoring Program, which tests ocean water near the mouth of most major creeks in the Santa Barbara County. A reading of more than 400 parts per million for fecal coliform, 104 for enterococcus, or 10,000 MPN (Most Probable Number, meaning the bacterial count per 100 mL of water) for total coliform exceeds state and federal standards, and can lead to a Department of Environmental Health Beach Advisory. Why are they important? The quality of water coming out of a watershed directly reflects what goes into the watershed and is an indicator of the watershed’s overall health. This not only affects the ability of residents to enjoy local creeks and beaches, but also affects the health of wildlife. In addition, unsafe beaches can adversely impact the local economy by reducing tourism. How are we doing? Water quality violation days remained relatively stable from 2013-2018, but 2019 saw a jump in both enteroccus and fecal coliform.The number of water quality violation days has fallen since, reaching the lowest numbers in over a decade. The amount of rainfall can significantly affect these results, as rainfall flushes bacteria and pollutants from the creeks into the ocean. Particulate Matter Levels Increase What are the measures? The number of days each year that Santa Barbara County exceeded state and federal standards for PM10 and PM2.5 levels. This data comes from the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District. Why are they important? Particulate matter is made up of fine particles in the air, such as those of dust, smoke, metal, and soot that can be harmful to humans’ lungs when inhaled. This pollutant is split up into two categories, PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 includes particles less than 10 microns in diameter and PM2.5 refers to much smaller particles that are no more than 2.5 microns in diameter. Because PM2.5 is much smaller, it can become lodged in the deepest parts of your lungs much more easily, making it a serious health threat, especially to people with respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. PM2.5 is caused primarily by vehicle emissions, burning of fuel, and wildfires. When PM2.5 is in the air there is much more caution that is necessary; when PM2.5 levels are high, people should limit outdoor exposure and exercising as much as possible. Additionally, if levels are particularly high or if one must go outside, it is beneficial to wear a mask with a filter. How are we doing? We almost never see PM2.5 exceedance days, but in 2017 there were 13 and 10 in 2020. In 2020, all exceedances occurred between July and October, which correlates to wildfire season in California. Being that 2020 was the largest wildfire season to date, it makes sense to see this second spike in PM2.5 exceedance days. Since then, exceedances have fallen to 0 once again. Land Use Energy Use Decreases What is the measure? The amount of electricity consumed by the Santa Barbara County for commercial, residential, and industrial purposes, measured in gigawatt hours. (One gigawatt hour equals one thousand megawatt hours.) Why is it important? Electric energy is a critical commodity, integrated into every aspect of our lives in our homes and workplaces. However, the production of electricity may have negative environmental impacts through pollution and resource use. How are we doing? Santa Barbara County energy use continues to decrease, dropping to its lowest consumption levels in over ten years. There has been an overall decline in energy use since 2014, apart from a small increase in 2018. Mobility Most Workers Commute Alone by Car What is the measure? North County and South County residents’ means of transport to work in 2022. Why is it important? Mobility reflects the ability of people to get from one place to another efficiently; consequentially, traffic congestion prevents this from happening. While traffic congestion has many components – including the level of non-commuter automobile use, population, the success of land-use planning, and the ability of infrastructure improvements to adapt to changes – the level of single occupancy vehicle use has a direct impact on overall traffic congestion. How are we doing? The majority of workers choose to commute alone by car. In South County, a higher number of individuals relied on transportation alternatives other than driving alone or carpooling. Mean Commute Time Rises Marginally What is the measure? The average amount of time it takes a commuter in North County and South County to travel to work in 2022. Why is it important? Commute distances traveled can reveal much about quality of life and future trends. Changing commute patterns may indicate a greater sensitivity toward housing costs and the economy. As the distance traveled increases, so does pollution, emission levels from automobiles, and traffic congestion. How are we doing? A majority of Santa Barbara residents have a commute time under 30 minutes. Since 2005, the average commute time for residents in Santa Barbara County has stayed relatively consistent within the range of 18.5-20.5 mins. Bus Ridership Decreasing What is the measure? The number of bus trips taken each year in Santa Barbara on Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) buses. Why is it important? Buses are popular means of alternative transportation in Santa Barbara. In many cases, they are the transportation mode of choice for those who cannot afford an automobile or are unable to drive. How are we doing? Since 2012, the number of bus trips has been declining. Most recently, total bus trips taken in the county has dropped to about 2.4 million in 2021, the lowest ridership levels in our data. Trips have nearly halved since 2020, and are roughly three times less than a decade ago. Resource Use Total Waste Disposed Sees Slight Increase What are the measures? The total tons of waste disposed in the Tajiguas, Santa Maria, and Lompoc landfills, as well as the amount of green waste and recycling diverted from the landfills. Why is it important? Waste disposal is a major form of urban pollution. Growing populations cause the total amount of waste to increase. Changes in the local economy, consumer purchasing decisions, and recycling and composting efforts also affect the amount of waste. How are we doing? Since 2014, the total waste disposed in the Santa Maria landfill has been steadily increasing, totaling 125,188 pounds in 2018. Similarly, the Tajiguas landfill (which serves most of the South Coast) has seen a large upward tick in total waste disposed; since 2014, total waste has increased from 175,099 pounds to 239,004 pounds in 2018. Conversely, the Lompoc landfill has seen relatively steady waste disposal levels. California had a statewide goal of reducing solid waste by 75 percent by 2020 through recycling, composting and source reduction. 2020 saw the highest levels of green waste per capita, with 197 pounds. One possible reason for this is that people spent more time gardening and renovating residential outdoor spaces during the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders. Recycling levels have remained relatively stable since 2015, except for a decrease in 2018 to 88 pounds per capita, the lowest level in our data. Nature Total Bird Count Decreases in 2020 What is the measure? The results of the Audubon Society’s annual Christmas Bird Count for four species. The bird count is designed as a measure of the diversity of bird species, but it can also be used as a rough indicator of how well bird species are thriving. Five common species are reported - the American Crow, the California Quail, Nuttall’s Woodpecker, the Western Meadowlark, and the Wrenti. All of these species are resident birds, living in different local habitats. Why is it important? Bird populations are an important part of our local ecosystem, and generally reflect its overall health. Changes in the bird count can indicate changes in habitats or other shifts in the local environment. Decreased sightings of these local bird species are likely due to the loss of local chaparral and woodlands. How are we doing? The American Crow is consistently the species with the most sightings each year; 2013 saw the largest counts, with 2,336 sightings. Most recently, sightings were 958, a record low. In 2015, Western Meadowlark sightings fell dramatically from 720 to 376, a 47 percent decline. This decrease is surprising considering the 129 percent increase seen from 2013 to 2014. Similar to the Western Meadowlarks, the number of California Quails also fell by 26 percent moving from 2014 to 2015 after increasing considerably the years before. In 2020, California Quail sightings reached 340, the highest in over a decade. Wrentit sightings have typically stayed between the range of 100-200 sightings since 2003, except for a particularly low count of 79 in 2005. Sightings have steadily increased since 2016. Nuttall’s Woodpecker is always the least common species to be reported; the lowest number ever reported was 17 in 2005 and the most sightings was in 2013 with just 84 sightings. Climate Average Temperatures are Rising What is the measure? The average annual temperatures from 1895 - 2022 in Santa Barbara County come from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. The data includes an aggregate of the daily average temperature from January to December of each year in degrees Fahrenheit. Why is it important? Temperature data can assist in monitoring the local impacts of climate change over time. The data can empower our community to take meaningful action in response to rising temperatures as a result of climate change. How are we doing? Average temperatures have been steadily rising since 1895. In 2014, the average temperature reached its peak at 61.8°F. The top 10 highest temperatures of the data were all within the past 10 years, with the exception of 1997 (8th) and 1992 (9th). The average temperature across the data was about 57°F, which we have not seen a value below since 1975. While temperature rise is a global concern, it is important for our community to monitor its effects and take action to reduce our impact on climate change.

This data consists of money income – exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains – before payment of personal income taxes, Social Security, union dues, Medicare deductions and the like. It excludes non-cash benefits such as food stamps or health benefits. The data is adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? This is the best measure of income in the context of the standard of living for households because it controls for changes in household size. It measures the ability of families to make necessary and discretionary expenditures on goods and services. How are we doing? Average household income in North and South County both averaged above $100,000. Median household income in South County remains higher than North County by just over 20%, at $94,481.15 and $78509.14 respectively. Real Average Salary per Worker Rises What is the measure? Real Average Salary is computed by summing total wages and salaries paid to all workers in the County, and then dividing by the total number of wage- and salary-earning employees. This is a countywide measure and is adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? While real median family income includes all residents and all sources of income, the real average wage per worker measures wages or salaries only. It is a better indicator of the health of local companies and the economic well-being of workers. How are we doing? The real average salary per worker increased slightly from last year’s level. It rose from $57,986 to $61,062 in 2021. This is a 25 percent increase from the average salary a decade ago (2011). Job Quality and Quantity Pandemic Impacts Industry Employment What is the measure? Employment in Santa Barbara County, sorted by industry. This data was formulated by the UCSB Economic Forecast Project, using California Employment Development Department (EDD) data. Why is it important? Shifts in the type of employment and associated wages can impact the real average worker’s salary and either enhance or constrain career opportunities for the local workforce. How are we doing? The pandemic hit Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Professional and Business Services, initially, the hardest. Following the onset of the pandemic in 2020, there has been general employment growth in all industries with most industries returning to pre-pandemic employment. Professional and Business Services’ employment has grown beyond pre-pandemic numbers, while Leisure and Hospitality has had the most rapid growth. Rental Rates Soar Post-pandemic What is the measure? Average apartment rental rates from Zillow’s Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for Santa Barbara County. The data displays median asking rent while controlling for differences in available rental stock. The gap in San Francisco’s trend is due to lack of available data. Why is it important? Similar to the housing affordability index, the cost of renting apartments is a major component of the cost of living in Santa Barbara County. The percentage change in apartment rental rates can be compared against measures of family income to determine if wages are keeping pace with rising rents. How are we doing? Rental rates throughout Santa Barbara County had the sharpest increase in August of 2021 at 4.16% , the highest growth rate increase in one month of all three counties observed since 2015. The sharpest decline in rental price for Santa Barbara County was in September of 2022 at -0.94%. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020, median rent grew from $2566.20 to $3619.75 by October of 2022, a 41% increase.
