This data consists of money income – exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains – before payment of personal income taxes, Social Security, union dues, Medicare deductions and the like. It excludes non-cash benefits such as food stamps or health benefits. The data is adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? This is the best measure of income in the context of the standard of living for households because it controls for changes in household size. It measures the ability of families to make necessary and discretionary expenditures on goods and services. How are we doing? Average household income in North and South County both averaged above $100,000. Median household income in South County remains higher than North County by just over 20%, at $94,481.15 and $78509.14 respectively. Real Average Salary per Worker Rises What is the measure? Real Average Salary is computed by summing total wages and salaries paid to all workers in the County, and then dividing by the total number of wage- and salary-earning employees. This is a countywide measure and is adjusted for inflation. Why is it important? While real median family income includes all residents and all sources of income, the real average wage per worker measures wages or salaries only. It is a better indicator of the health of local companies and the economic well-being of workers. How are we doing? The real average salary per worker increased slightly from last year’s level. It rose from $57,986 to $61,062 in 2021. This is a 25 percent increase from the average salary a decade ago (2011). Job Quality and Quantity Pandemic Impacts Industry Employment What is the measure?
