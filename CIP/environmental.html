<h4>What are the measures?<a href="environmental.html#what-are-the-measures-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The number of weekly water quality tests that exceed state and federal standards for ecoli, fecal coliform, total coliform, and enterococcus. This data is from the County Ocean Water Monitoring Program, which tests ocean water near the mouth of most major creeks in the Santa Barbara County. A reading of more than 400 parts per million for fecal coliform, 104 for enterococcus, or 10,000 MPN (Most Probable Number, meaning the bacterial count per 100 mL of water) for total coliform exceeds state and federal standards, and can lead to a Department of Environmental Health Beach Advisory.</p>

<p>The quality of water coming out of a watershed directly reflects what goes into the watershed and is an indicator of the watershed’s overall health. This not only affects the ability of residents to enjoy local creeks and beaches, but also affects the health of wildlife. In addition, unsafe beaches can adversely impact the local economy by reducing tourism.</p>

<p>Water quality violation days remained relatively stable from 2013-2018, but 2019 saw a jump in both enteroccus and fecal coliform.The number of water quality violation days has fallen since, reaching the lowest numbers in over a decade. The amount of rainfall can significantly affect these results, as rainfall flushes bacteria and pollutants from the creeks into the ocean.</p>

<!-- ### Water Consumption Declines {-} -->
<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- The gallons of water consumed per day for residential purposes by the customers of all the principal water agencies within Santa Barbara County.  -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- The amount of water consumed by residents of Santa Barbara County is especially important in times of drought conditions. The County has taken several steps to reduce residential water consumption, which appears to have had a positive effect on lowering overall water usage. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- California’s longest drought since 2000 occurred from 2011-2019. During that time, countywide water consumption declined, with marked decreases beginning in 2013. Montecito, Santa Ynez, and La Cumbre continue to have the highest per capita consumption of water out of the County. Guadalupe, Santa Maria, Lompoc, Goleta, Carpinteria, and Santa Barbara have the lowest per capita water consumption in the county, with levels remaining relatively stable throughout our data.  -->

<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- The number of days in which local communities did not meet the state standard for ozone levels. If a daily ozone reading exceeds an hourly average of 0.09 parts per million, or an eight hour average of 0.07 parts per million, a state “violation day” occurs. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- Ozone – one of the primary components of smog – impairs normal functioning of the lungs and reduces the ability to perform physical exercise. Lack of ozone in the air is considered to be a good indicator of overall air quality. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- In 2016, Santa Barbara County only experienced three days of ozone violation where the air quality exceeded the state 8-hour standard. While this is an increase of one day from 2015 statistics, air quality has improved dramatically over the past twenty years, even despite an overall rise in population. In October 2015, the EPA passed a new federal mandate reducing the 8-hour ozone violation from 0.075 parts per million to 0.070 parts per million. Most recently, Santa Barbara County only had one violation day in 2019. -->

<p>The number of days each year that Santa Barbara County exceeded state and federal standards for PM10 and PM2.5 levels. This data comes from the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District.</p>

<h4>Why are they important?<a href="environmental.html#why-are-they-important-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Particulate matter is made up of fine particles in the air, such as those of dust, smoke, metal, and soot that can be harmful to humans’ lungs when inhaled. This pollutant is split up into two categories, PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 includes particles less than 10 microns in diameter and PM2.5 refers to much smaller particles that are no more than 2.5 microns in diameter. Because PM2.5 is much smaller, it can become lodged in the deepest parts of your lungs much more easily, making it a serious health threat, especially to people with respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. PM2.5 is caused primarily by vehicle emissions, burning of fuel, and wildfires. When PM2.5 is in the air there is much more caution that is necessary; when PM2.5 levels are high, people should limit outdoor exposure and exercising as much as possible. Additionally, if levels are particularly high or if one must go outside, it is beneficial to wear a mask with a filter.</p>

<h4>How are we doing?<a href="environmental.html#how-are-we-doing-6" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>We almost never see PM2.5 exceedance days, but in 2017 there were 13 and 10 in 2020. In 2020, all exceedances occurred between July and October, which correlates to wildfire season in California. Being that 2020 was the largest wildfire season to date, it makes sense to see this second spike in PM2.5 exceedance days. Since then, exceedances have fallen to 0 once again.</p>

<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- The number of businesses in Santa Barbara County that release airborne toxic contaminants which exceed the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District’s thresholds for significant health risks. Three categories of toxic chemicals are measured – those that pose cancer risks, those that pose acute health risks, and those that pose chronic health risks unrelated to cancer. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- Toxic air contaminants pose a direct threat to the health of people who work at businesses that exceed safety thresholds and to those who live or work immediately adjacent to those businesses. In addition, the toxic contaminants harm overall air quality in Santa Barbara County. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- The number of businesses exceeding health risk thresholds dropped to zero in 2015 and has stayed at zero for the past seven years. This is even more significant when stricter changes in guidelines are taken into account; in 2015, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment revised the guidance manual to account for sensitivity to cancer at early ages, possibly resulting in increased risk results.  -->

<!-- </div> -->
<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- The total pounds of pesticides used for both agricultural and non-agricultural reasons throughout Santa Barbara County. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- Pesticides are most commonly used in agriculture to prevent crop loss due to insects and diseases. Outside of agriculture, pesticides can also be used to limit household pests, such as rats and other rodents. Many activities involving pesticides can affect ground and groundwater quality, most of which are difficult to track. Agricultural pesticide use is one possible precursor to ground or groundwater contamination. Impacts on natural environmental processes can in turn lead to adverse health effects for humans. About 70% of all pesticide use in Santa Barbara County is within North County. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- After a large spike in pesticide use in 2012 – amounting to 6.18 million pounds – overall use declined significantly in 2013. While there was a small spike in 2016 of 5.24 million pounds, levels have declined since then to a level of 4.55 million pounds in 2018. The lowest level of pesticide usage was observed in 2009, with only 3.73 million pounds.  -->

<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- The top five sites of pesticide use throughout Santa Barbara County in 2018. This data comes from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- Countywide pesticide use totaled 4,547,073 pounds in 2018. Five types of crops constituted about 82 percent of this total pesticide use including strawberries, grapes and wine, carrots, lemons, and flowers. These crops may be located in specific agricultural areas where pesticide use becomes more concentrated. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- The strawberry crop is the leading site for pesticide use in Santa Barbara County, with 2,058,058 pounds of pesticides used in 2018. This is about 45% of total pesticide use throughout the county.  -->

<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- The number of workplace pesticide related illnesses and injuries experienced in Santa Barbara County. This measure includes antimicrobial agents such as chlorine. As of 2018, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) no longer updates this data. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- Many factors influence our health, including environmental factors. Workplace pesticide related illnesses are one of those that are regularly tracked. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- The number of reported illnesses related to pesticides has typically remained under 20 cases a year, with three major exceptions. In 2012 and 2013 there was a dramatic increase in the number of workplace pesticide related illnesses, with 56 and 47 cases respectively. This was more than a 200 percent increase from the previous years. From 2014-2017 there was a major decrease; despite a small spike of 15 cases in 2015, this is a considerable improvement from the high volume of illnesses and injuries related to workplace pesticide use reported from 2012-2013.  -->

<p>Mobility reflects the ability of people to get from one place to another efficiently; consequentially, traffic congestion prevents this from happening. While traffic congestion has many components – including the level of non-commuter automobile use, population, the success of land-use planning, and the ability of infrastructure improvements to adapt to changes – the level of single occupancy vehicle use has a direct impact on overall traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Commute distances traveled can reveal much about quality of life and future trends. Changing commute patterns may indicate a greater sensitivity toward housing costs and the economy. As the distance traveled increases, so does pollution, emission levels from automobiles, and traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Since 2014, the total waste disposed in the Santa Maria landfill has been steadily increasing, totaling 125,188 pounds in 2018. Similarly, the Tajiguas landfill (which serves most of the South Coast) has seen a large upward tick in total waste disposed; since 2014, total waste has increased from 175,099 pounds to 239,004 pounds in 2018. Conversely, the Lompoc landfill has seen relatively steady waste disposal levels.</p>
<p>California had a statewide goal of reducing solid waste by 75 percent by 2020 through recycling, composting and source reduction. 2020 saw the highest levels of green waste per capita, with 197 pounds. One possible reason for this is that people spent more time gardening and renovating residential outdoor spaces during the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders. Recycling levels have remained relatively stable since 2015, except for a decrease in 2018 to 88 pounds per capita, the lowest level in our data.</p>

<h4>What is the measure?<a href="environmental.html#what-is-the-measure-8" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The results of the Audubon Society’s annual Christmas Bird Count for four species. The bird count is designed as a measure of the diversity of bird species, but it can also be used as a rough indicator of how well bird species are thriving.</p>
<p>Five common species are reported - the American Crow, the California Quail, Nuttall’s Woodpecker, the Western Meadowlark, and the Wrenti. All of these species are resident birds, living in different local habitats.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-is-it-important-9" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Why is it important?<a href="environmental.html#why-is-it-important-9" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Bird populations are an important part of our local ecosystem, and generally reflect its overall health. Changes in the bird count can indicate changes in habitats or other shifts in the local environment. Decreased sightings of these local bird species are likely due to the loss of local chaparral and woodlands.</p>

<div id="how-are-we-doing-12" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>How are we doing?<a href="environmental.html#how-are-we-doing-12" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The American Crow is consistently the species with the most sightings each year; 2013 saw the largest counts, with 2,336 sightings. Most recently, sightings were 958, a record low.</p>
<p>In 2015, Western Meadowlark sightings fell dramatically from 720 to 376, a 47 percent decline. This decrease is surprising considering the 129 percent increase seen from 2013 to 2014.</p>
<p>Similar to the Western Meadowlarks, the number of California Quails also fell by 26 percent moving from 2014 to 2015 after increasing considerably the years before. In 2020, California Quail sightings reached 340, the highest in over a decade.</p>
<p>Wrentit sightings have typically stayed between the range of 100-200 sightings since 2003, except for a particularly low count of 79 in 2005. Sightings have steadily increased since 2016.</p>
<p>Nuttall’s Woodpecker is always the least common species to be reported; the lowest number ever reported was 17 in 2005 and the most sightings was in 2013 with just 84 sightings.</p>
