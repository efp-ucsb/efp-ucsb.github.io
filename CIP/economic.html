<p>The pandemic hit Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Professional and Business Services, initially, the hardest. Following the onset of the pandemic in 2020, there has been general employment growth in all industries with most industries returning to pre-pandemic employment. Professional and Business Services’ employment has grown beyond pre-pandemic numbers, while Leisure and Hospitality has had the most rapid growth.</p>
<!-- ### Average Salaries in Santa Barbara County {-} -->
<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- Average salary by industry in Santa Barbara County is compared for 2010 and 2015. These two snapshots of Santa Barbara County average salary data, sorted by industry, are derived from California Employment Development Department data sources. This measure is inflation-adjusted and presented in 2009 dollars. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- While a number of factors contribute to quality employment – such as job satisfaction, the quality of the workplace and co-workers – the level of pay is an important aspect of job quality and the easiest to measure. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- Average salaries in most sectors in Santa Barbara County have been on the rise since 2010. The sectors with the largest growth in average salaries are information (35 percent), agriculture (25 percent), and financial activities (10 percent). The only industry that declined was education and health services (a less than 1 percent loss). -->

<!-- ### Job and Population Growth Rates Vary {-} -->
<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- These indicators measure the difference between the the job growth rate and the population growth rate for both North County and South Coast. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- When the rate of job creation exceeds the rate of population growth, with no change in labor force participation, the net result is a reduction in unemployment. Job creation reflects economic expansion and the health of local firms and is a measure of the vitality of the local economy. Job creation and population growth also puts pressure on the housing market and may lead to longer commute, perhaps from outside the region. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- Job growth trends often mirror population growth trends. While South Coast patterns tend to be somewhat correlated, a large discrepancy in population and employment trends has not been seen in recent years. In 2015, the job growth exceeded population growth. For North County, job growth has exceeded population growth recently. -->

<!-- The public sector plays a central role in our society, providing important services such as police, fire, and environmental protection, education and social services. An increase in the proportion of government workers in the population may be seen by some as negative –signaling higher taxes, a constraining regulatory environment and a cumbersome bureaucracy. For others, the same measurement may indicate an improvement in public services. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- In 2015, there were approximately 87.4 government workers per 1,000 residents. This data includes employees in the education sector, which represents a large majority of these employment numbers. -->

<!-- #### What is the measure? {-} -->
<!-- This measure is an estimate of the percentage of households that can afford to own a median-priced home. This index uses data from the California Association of Realtors, and uses a different methodology in estimating affordability. We have chosen to highlight affordability indices between neighboring counties, California, and the United States. -->
<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- Comparing this index with those of other counties, the state, and the nation provides some sense of just how different the Santa Barbara County housing market is from Ventura County, San Luis Obispo County, the state as a whole, and the United States. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- Almost without exception, Santa Barbara County has had the least affordable housing of the regions shown for the last ten years. Affordability in 2016 has followed this trend with only 20 percent of households able to afford a median-priced home. The 2010 spike up in affordability was a result of the large decline in housing prices just after the Great Recession. -->

<!-- #### Why is it important? {-} -->
<!-- The direction of available commercial space reflects the overall business climate and rate of commercial development. Inadequate space coupled with higher costs of leasing may act as a constraint on economic expansion. -->
<!-- #### How are we doing? {-} -->
<!-- In 2016, vacant office space increased to 646,000 square feet after two years of decline, which still remains only 66 percent of 2010 levels. Industrial vacancies decreased 19 percent from the prior year to 212,000 square feet. Retail space available grew slightly to 163,000 square feet, but still follows a declining trend. In 2016, the gross lease rates for each type of space increased. The high demands for office space has allowed the rates to rise to \$2.44 per square foot, which is the highest it’s been for the past decade. Similarly, gross lease rates for the industrial and retail space also reached record highs in 2016, at \$1.63 and \$3.97 per square foot, respectively. -->
