With their help we are able to provide timely information to our community and to hire and train undergraduate students in data collection and analysis. I would also like to thank our Board of Directors for their guidance and thoughtful advice. David Marshall, Executive Vice Chancellor at UCSB deserves special mention for supporting the EFP throughout the years. Thanks to Kenneth Freeland, our business officer who manages the day to day operations. Thomas Fullager and Sarah Papich, Ph.D. students in the Economics Department, oversee data collection, content and also work with the undergrad interns to produce this document. Despite the best efforts of the pandemic and the Fed, the economy keeps rolling along, hardly missing a beat. While the pandemic created turmoil never before seen, the labor market weathered the storm and has climbed back to where we are now about 3.3 million more employees than the pre-pandemic level in February of 2021. The unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since the late 1960’s. Santa Barbara county has also shown to be a resilient economy. 2022 saw an increase in employment of 8,733 workers compared to 2021. The unemployment rate in the county fell to 3.52% at the end of 2022. However, across the county there was a large discrepancy. The unemployment rate in Santa Maria stood at 5.62% while it was only 0.1% in Santa Ynez Valley. Leisure and hospitality employment in Santa Barbara has come back strongly since the nose dive during the pandemic while retail employment continues to decline. The declining employment in retail in Santa Barbara began in 2000. It is unclear what is driving the decline since retail employment in Ventura county has increased substantially and San Luis Obispo has seen a small gain.
