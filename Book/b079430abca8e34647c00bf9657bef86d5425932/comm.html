<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Local Demographics</h3>
<p>The tri-counties area is composed of Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, and San Luis Obispo Counties. In 2019, population growth dipped into the negative with a –0.15% growth. The tri-counties experienced its highest growth rate in 2013 and 2014 of about 0.9% in both years, according to the recorded data. Each of the three counties recorded negative population growth, which contributed to the tri-county data. Santa Barbara experienced a –0.16% growth rate, Ventura county experienced –0.19% growth rates, and San Luis Obispo experienced a –0.02% growth rate.</p>
<p>In Santa Barbara County specifically, the unincorporated areas of Santa Barbara experienced the highest growth rates in 2019 at 1.59%. On the other hand, many areas of Santa Barbara experienced negative growth. This includes Santa Maria, Santa Barbara City, and Lompoc. Among cities with a negative growth rate, Santa Maria faced the lowest growth rate, at –1.68%. This is a staggering difference compared to 2018, when Santa Maria had a positive growth rate of 0.46%.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Components of Change</h3>
<p>According to data from the California Department of Finance, the population in Santa Barbara County as of July 2019, was higher than the population for July of 2018. The difference in population numbers most likely stems from differences in the collection methods used and the treatment of unincorporated areas, and differences in the areas incorporated into the overall Santa Barbara County population. However, the Department of Finance still shows that population growth is significantly lower than the average growth seen in past years. The recorded data by the Department of Finance dating back to the year 2000 indicates that average growth in the 19-year span is annually positive by 2,980 people. However, in 2019, the population only increased by 1,576. Furthermore, the increase in population was largely due to low deaths and high births in Santa Barbara County. Net migration in and out of Santa Barbara county was –408 people. This is the first time that net migration was negative since 2011 according to the data provided by the Department of Finance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> Demographic Detail</h3>
<p>Incorporated areas of Santa Barbara County are expected to see population decrease to 450,900 in 2020, down from the existing population of 453,000 in 2019. Among the decreasing population, there is no clear trend of groups of age demographics that are significantly increasing or decreasing. Similarly, gender groups do not indicate significant differences. However, change of population is seen more clearly in ethnicities in Santa Barbara County. The number of people categorized as white are seen to have a decreasing population, whereas Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Any Race have increasing populations.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.5</span> Housing</h3>
<p>According to the Department of Finance, there are a total of 160,111 housing units in Santa Barbara County in 2019. This is a 0.94 percent increase from the household count of 158,622 last year in 2018. This contrasts with the recorded increase in population of only 0.25 percent from 2018. Furthermore, the vacancy rate increased from 6.20 to 6.60 in the past year. The housing density has remained very steady since 2014, and has only fluctuated between 2.9 and 2.91.</p>
<p>Housing sizes vary across counties, but South Santa Barbara County has a higher percentage of low household population compared to North Santa Barbara County. Two-person households are the most common all across Santa Barbara County. Over 30 percent of South County’s households are two-person.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Crime</h2>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Violent crime rate slightly increased in Santa Barbara County between 2017 and 2018 but remains low relative to past crime rates since 1994.</li>
<li>Carpinteria and Buellton violent crime decreased the most out of any other city, while Lompoc remains the leader in violent crime rates.</li>
<li>Guadalupe has the lowest property crime rate, while Santa Barbara city had the highest in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past 10 years (2008-2018), both property and violent crime has declined. The only exceptions are a 60 percent increase of violent crime in Goleta, and a 14 percent increase in property crime in Lompoc. Comparing the most recent 2018 data for crime in Santa Barbara and the United States as a whole, there are 13.08 property crimes and 2.68 violent crimes for every 1,000 individuals in Santa Barbara County; in comparison, the U.S. has 22 property crimes and 3.69 violent crimes per 1,000 people. We will discuss the trends and break down the composition of crime in this section.</p>

<div id="property-crime" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Property Crime</h3>
<p>As defined by The California Department of Justice, property crime is divided into three separate categories: burglary, motor vehicle theft, and larceny-theft. Larceny-theft makes up 68 percent of property crimes in 2018, totaling 5203 total crimes. The high percentage of larceny-theft is most likely attributed to the ease at which people can steal and resell small items through shoplifting, purse snatching, building and bicycle theft, etc. The second largest category of property crime was burglary, which constituted 17%, totaling 1322 in 2018. Motor vehicle thefts made up the smallest amount at 15%.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara County property crime rates decreased for the second year in a row, falling by 23 percent from 2016 to 2018. All cities experienced this decrease. Solvang had the largest decrease at 40.71 percent less property crime than last year. Guadalupe has maintained the smallest property crime rate for the past three years, and Santa Barbara City has the highest property crime rates in the county, with 24.6 crimes for every 1,000 people in 2018.</p>

<div id="violent-crime" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Violent Crime</h3>
<p>Violent crime is separated into four sections: homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In 2018, Santa Barbara County’s violent crimes were mostly aggravated assaults, which made up 62% of violent crimes and totaled 931 counts, a modest decrease of 4 counts since 2017. The lowest percentage of violent crimes was homicides, which was 0.7% of total violent crimes and totaled 11 counts. In total, the number of violent crimes in Santa Barbara County decreased from 1,526 in 2017 to 1,493 in 2018.</p>
<p>Violent crime rates increased in three cities, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Guadalupe. Violent crime declined most significantly in Buellton, where crime rates dropped by 51 percent. Lompoc continues to have the highest violent crime rate in the county. Relatively low rates in the rest of the County’s cities are offset by high rates in Unincorporated areas across the county, which do not report their crime data by area.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Education</h2>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Charter school enrollment in Santa Barbara County has seen an increase in recent years.</li>
<li>Enrollment at the University of California, Santa Barbara continues to rise, reaching a record high of 26,314 students for Fall Quarter in 2019.</li>
<li>High School graduation rates increased for California, from 83.0% to 84.5%, and decreased slightly for Santa Barbara County, from 87.4% to 86.8%.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Santa Barbara County, public school enrollment dropped 0.5% between the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years, experiencing a slight decrease of 345 students. In fact, over the next 10 years, public K-12 enrollment is projected to shrink 2.1% compared to the 5.2% of growth experienced from the prior 10 years. So, where are the parents of Santa Barbara County taking their children? While most students attend public schools, there is evidence to suggest that a large portion of parents are choosing private schools, particularly religious ones. Private school enrollment declined very slightly by 21 students in 2018 but increased as a proportion of total enrollment reaching 7.13%. Charter schools, which are counted as public schools, have experienced significant increases in enrollment over the past 4 years. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, enrollment increased by 765 students, and in 2018 charter schools continued to add an additional 74 students. This trend has been the result of numerous new charter schools opening in Santa Barbara County and has been matched by a steady decrease in non-charter enrollment.</p>

<p>In 2019, University of California, Santa Barbara Fall quarter enrollment broke a new record of 26,314 students, increasing 1.3% from last Fall quarter. Allan Hancock College registration increased from 13,410 to 13,856 in 2019. Santa Barbara City College enrolled 14,100 students this past Fall, dropping 6% from its 2018 enrollment, and continuing on a declining trend since 2013.</p>

<div id="expenditures-on-education" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> Expenditures on Education</h3>
<p>Using the following figures, we display the year-to-year changes in education expenditures at the state, county, and district level. These expenditures include the following costs: salaries, benefits, acquisitions, and construction. To measure these changes, we use the cost per average daily attendance (ADA), which measures the number of days of student attendance divided by the total number of days of instruction.</p>
<p>At the state and county levels, expenditures per ADA continued the upward trend that began in 2013. For the 2018-19 school year, expenditures per ADA for the state and county rose by 8.6% and 9.1%, respectively. In contrast, the 2017-2018 school year saw this measure grow by 4.5% and 4.0% for state and county respectively. Specifically, for Santa Barbara County, spending per student varies widely across the school districts; although, nearly every district saw an increase during the 2018-2019 school year. Buellton Union Elementary, College Elementary, and Los Olivos Elementary were the only districts to experience declines. Montecito Union elementary once again holds highest cost per ADA.</p>
<p>When looking at the growth trend of school spending, it is helpful to also consider indicators such as average class size, student teacher ratios, and other performance measures to better understand the trend. For example, the increase in the cost per ADA could be attributed to either an increase in expenditures or a fall in enrollment. The rise for this year may be due in part to the decline in enrollment if education spending has not sufficiently adjusted to the decrease. Alternatively, general increases in spending could account for increased costs, however these changes cannot be directly observed. Thus, we cannot determine which of these factors is the driving force.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> Performance Indicators</h3>
<p>Created by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), the California Assessment of Student Performance Progress (CASSPP) replaced the STAR exam in the Spring of 2014 due to state efforts to change testing from multiple choice and memorization to more interactive questions that require critical analysis skills. Since the trial run in 2013-2014, the 2018-19 academic year will be the fifth year of publicly released results.</p>
<p>Once again, the California state average exceeded Santa Barbara County’s average in both English and math. For grade 3 English, Santa Barbara had 43% of its students score in the Standard Met and Above categories in comparison to California’s 49%. In grade 5, California scored higher than Santa Barbara County with 52% of students in the top two categories, compared to Santa Barbara’s 47%. For grade 11, Santa Barbara County had 53% in the top two categories compared to California’s 57%.</p>
<p>For grade 3 math, Santa Barbara County had 44% of their students score in the Standard Met and Above categories, while California had 50%. For grade 5, both California and Santa Barbara County topped last year’s performance, with 38% of California students and 32% of Santa Barbara students in the top two categories, compared to 36% and 29% last year. In grade 11, Santa Barbara County had 29% of its students achieve Standard Met and Above, the same as last year, and California had 32% of students achieve this level.</p>
<p><img src="figs/CAASPPenglish-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><img src="figs/CAASPPmath-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>In 2013, the California State Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science Standards which focuses on creating a shift in science education to have students express more conceptual and applied understanding of the material. As of 2019, the new California Science Test (CAST) was finalized and results are available for the first cohort of students taking the exam.</p>
<p><img src="figs/CAASPPscience-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Notably, students in grade 3 were not required to take the CAST exam and many students in grade 11 did not have scores listed. Similar to the English and Math tests, California as a whole performed higher than Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>The California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) was made to demonstrate a competency of English-language arts and mathematics and was required in order to earn a high school diploma. In October 2015, the CAHSEE was suspended for the 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 school years due to a change in academic standards. Moreover, our usual data for SAT scores by section is no longer available due to revisions in the test. Therefore, we are unable to present SAT testing data for the 2018-19 academic year.</p>
<p>In 2019, graduation rates increased for the state of California, from 83.0% in the previous year to 84.5%, but decreased slightly for Santa Barbara County, from 87.4% to 86.8%. In addition, the dropout rate continued on a declining trend at the state level. Within the county however, the dropout rate reached 9.4% which was higher than the State level of 9.0%. The percentage of UC/CSU eligible graduates increased in both the county and the state with Santa Barbara county making a significant jump from 27.8% to 38.2%. It is important to note that collection methods for the graduation data used in the previously mentioned statistics changed in the 2016-17 school year when the California Department of Education began recording graduation rate and outcome data in a single aggregate data set as opposed to separate research files. This accounts for the striking increase in the dropout rate between 2015 and 2016. As a result, years after 2016 are not comparable to years prior to 2016.</p>

<p>2019 has a substantial increase in total rainfall, experiencing 132% of normal water-year rainfall, measured from September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019. 2019 is a “Wet Year” – defined as a year that has received more than 80% of normal rain.
Santa Barbara County no longer remained in a drought, after a large increase in rainfall since 2018. Santa Barbara City, Santa Ynez, and Santa Maria, saw substantial increases in rainfall compared to 2018, which was a dry year. Santa Barbara City received 25.85 inches of rainfall, 43% above its mean annual rainfall of 18.12 inches. Santa Maria saw 15.97 inches of rain, 22% above its mean annual rainfall of 13.07 inches. Lastly, Santa Ynez received 20.07 inches of rain, 27% above its mean annual rainfall of 15.84.

<p>Cachuma reservoir, Gibraltar reservoir, and Jameson reservoir are Santa Barbara County’s major reservoirs for water. After 2018’s below average rainfall, water levels in the three reservoirs declined towards the end of the 2018. However, the three reservoirs all saw an increase in their water levels in 2019.
Reservoir levels are measured in acre-feet; one acre-foot is approximately 325,851 gallons. Cachuma is the largest reservoir with a capacity of 193,305 acre-feet. Over the last year, Cachuma reservoir experienced an increase in water storage, going from holding 33% of capacity, to holding 77%. Jameson reservoir moved from carrying 58% to 90% of its maximum water levels of 4,848 acre-feet. Lastly, the smallest reservoir, Gibraltar was the only major reservoir to experience a decrease in water storage, going from 78% to 59% capacity over the year.</p>

<p>In 2018, the amount of gallons of water consumed per day for residential purposes within Santa Barbara County increased by an average of 3.7% across all cities. Water consumption had been declining in the County since 2013, largely driven by regulation due to the drought. Montecito had the highest percentage increase from 2017 to 2018 of 8.29%; on the other hand, Casmalia and Cuyama decreased their water consumption by 9.3% and 5%, respectively. Personal daily water consumption varies widely between cities, with Santa Ynez and Montecito at 242 and 222 gallons per day respectively, and Goleta at 52 gallons per day: the lowest consumption figure in the county.</p>

<div id="air-quality" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.4.4</span> Air Quality</h3>
<p>The Santa Barbara Air Pollution Control District has a network of monitoring stations to record the concentration of various air pollutants. Air quality is presented in terms of the number of days the ozone level exceeded the state 8-hour standard of .070 parts per million. In the long view, Santa Barbara County has experienced air quality improvements, which can be seen in the declining number of state 1-hours and 8-hour ozone exceedances that have occurred between 1990 and 2019.
Neither 2018 or 2019 experienced any days where ozone levels exceeded the state 1-hour standard. However, 2019 experienced 1 ozone exceedance day where the ozone level exceeded the state 8-hour standard while 2018 had none. 2019’s 1 exceedance day marks one of the lowest levels since 1990, when the number of state 8-hour ozone exceedance days was 87.</p>
<p>The attainment designation of the California Clean Air Act monitors whether Santa Barbara air meets certain health standards. These standards tell us how much of a substance can be in the air without causing harm, based on proven medical research. In order to be designated attainment for the state ozone standard, the data must show that the standard was not violated during the previous three calendar years. With 1 exceedance day in 2019, which went up from 0 exceedance days in 2018, Santa Barbara Country will still need three calendar years of not violating the standard in order to have reached attainment for the state ozone standard.</p>

<div id="electricity-consumption" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.4.5</span> Electricity Consumption</h3>
<p>Santa Barbara County’s energy use dropped by 0.29% in 2018, following a declining trend and hitting a new 15 year low of 2,791 gigawatt hours. Most of the decrease is attributed to the residential energy use decreasing by 1.32%. Conversely, non-residential energy increased by only 0.00094%. Environmentally, conservation of energy helps maintain the quality of the environment and reduces pollution. We should expect to continue seeing a decrease in energy consumption as Santa Barbara County establishes its own renewable sources to achieve 100% sustainable energy goals by 2030 – as voted on by the City Council in June 2017.</p>
