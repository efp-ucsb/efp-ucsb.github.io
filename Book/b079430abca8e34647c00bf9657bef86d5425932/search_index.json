We are a true community bank founded and owned by our customers who are local business people, non-profits, investors and entrepreneurs. Everyone at American Riviera Bank recognizes that our clients are stakeholders in our vision and that is why we are committed to building enduring and loyal relationships. As a result of these relationships, American Riviera Bank has become the Central Coast’s community bank of choice and has experienced significant organic growth. As of December 31, 2018 we reported over $600 million in total assets which was made possible by total deposits increasing 14% and total loans increasing 23% from December 31, 2017. For eight consecutive years the Bank has been recognized for strong financial performance by the Findley Reports, and received the highest “Super Premier” rating from Findley.. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was rated five stars by Bauer Financial. In 2017, American Riviera Bank expanded into San Luis Obispo County with a Loan Production Office in Paso Robles. We subsequently purchased and renovated a building at 1601 Spring Street in Paso Robles, where a full service branch opened in March 2018. In December 2018 we opened a new Loan Production Office at 1085 Higuera Street in downtown San Luis Obispo and expect our full service branch to be open in May, 2019at the same location.

Since 1850, Santa Barbara County government has a history of providing excellent and responsive public service while operating under sound fiscal principles. County government is comprised of 21 departments and agencies, and a 4,200-person workforce that strive to provide for the health and safety of residents and visitors. The Board of Supervisors is the legislative and executive body of Santa Barbara government, comprised of five elected officials representing each of the county supervisory districts. Departments make recommendations to the Board and implement its actions. The Sheriff-Coroner, District Attorney, Clerk-Recorder-Assessor, Treasurer-Tax Collector-Public Administrator, and Auditor-Controller are independently elected offices. The vital role of County government became all the more clear in late 2017 with the Thomas Fire followed by the devastating debris flow on January 9, 2018. The idea of community and resiliency took on new meaning as members of the public, private and nonprofit sectors came together to respond to the monumental task of providing support for those impacted, ensuring public safety and rebuilding a vital, healthy community for residents and visitors alike. The $1.1 billion adopted Fiscal Year 2018-19 budget provides funding for important initiatives, ongoing and new mandates and liabilities, and increased levels of funding for prior Board commitments – all within the context of recovering from one of the largest disasters the County has encountered in recent history. In 2018, the state of California provided $1.4 million in one-time funding to back-fill the County’s property tax losses incurred in 2017-18 and 2018-19 because of the fire and debris flow disasters. The Board assigned these funds and an additional $4.5 million to repay 94 percent of the $6.3 million pulled from the County’s Strategic Reserve for disaster response activities. Despite the challenges, the County continues to build a better government that is responsive and accountable. In 2018, the Board approved moving forward on more than 100 initiatives generated by Renew 2022, a multi-year program to re-vision and transform Santa Barbara County government by the year 2022 and beyond.

The results of this vision are many and include a hard working, high quality and fiscally sound organization with objective goals and measurable achievements. Since 1969, the Housing Authority has developed and/or secured over 4,000 units of affordable rental housing for Santa Barbara through a variety of programs, including workforce housing, public housing, congregate living facilities for frail seniors, supportive housing for the homeless as well as the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. Through Section 8 alone, the Housing Authority infuses over $32 million per year in federal tax revenue to the South Coast economy. The Authority’s dedicated Board of Commissioners and staff ensure that HACSB continues to be a well-managed, compassionate and effective affordable housing and service provider. In 2007, the Housing Authority of the City of Santa Barbara formed an affiliate non-profit, 2nd Story Associates out of the recognition of a growing unmet need for sufficient affordable housing and expanded resident service programs for low-Income families, seniors and disabled individuals in Santa Barbara. 2nd Story’s programs promote a holistic service approach to low income households by promoting educational opportunities for children, economic advancement for adults and overall self-sufficiency programs for entire families. 2nd Story has also become instrumental in the funding and development of new affordable housing. As an affiliate non-profit, they have helped the Housing Authority access certain forms of financing that is not always available to public agencies. The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara is founded on the belief that decent, safe and sanitary housing is central to the physical and emotional health, productivity, and self-esteem of the people it serves. Our mission is primarily to build, acquire, own, manage and maintain residential rental units for persons of extremely low, very low and low-income and to obtain rent payment assistance for similar households renting in the private market. Operating through a central Administrative Office in Lompoc and Housing Management and Maintenance offices in Goleta, Lompoc and Santa Maria, the Authority provides direct services to applicants, tenants and private property owners. In 2018, the Executive Director and staff will implement a combined agency-wide budget of approximately $50 million while serving 4,800 extremely low, very low and low-income households. Of the 4,800 households served, 3,400 are assisted in privately owned rentals through the federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, operated locally since 1975. The Authority also owns, manages and maintains 1,324 residential rental units throughout Santa Barbara County. The Housing Authority, since its creation in 1941, has undertaken new construction and acquisition development activities in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county. We partner with seven cities and the County of Santa Barbara to perform a variety of housing-related services in support of local plans. www.hasbarco.org Harold and Betty Hutton, entrepreneurs, adventurers and business partners, began their business as a small refining operation in Long Beach in the early 1950s and by the middle of the 70’s became a leading exporter of oil and natural gas from South East Asia. In 1975, while living and working in Indonesia, Harold Hutton passed away suddenly. After his death, Betty decided to close the company’s oil operation in South East Asia and return to her roots in Orange, California. It was there, following a short retirement, that she established Hutton Companies, a commercial real estate development corporation. In 1984, Betty Hutton asked Tom Parker to assume a management role at Hutton Companies. Together, Tom and Betty worked to grow and stabilize Hutton Companies as well as to fund and activate the Foundation. Betty Hutton passed away unexpectedly in September of 1995.

The business which was started out of necessity by Mario F Borgatello and his brother Charles Borgatello has evolved over time from a two man operation to over 350 employees. In 1911 Segundo and Josephine Borgatello immigrated to Santa Barbara, Californian from Asti, Italy. Within months of Segundo’s youngest child’s birth he passed away leaving Josephine to care for 5 very young children. She did what she could to support her family by working as a seamstress and taking in other immigrant workers from Italy into her home. The family struggled for many years and at very young ages the children did whatever jobs they could to help their mother survive financially. In the late 1930’s, Mario F Borgatello started a small business in the rural hills of Montecito, California. Together with his brother Charles they would walk great distances from house to house to collect food waste to feed the hogs that their mother was raising. Soon many of their customers asked them to start taking away all their trash items and hence a family business was started out of others people trash. In endeavoring to grow the seeds of recycling and preservation that were planted by Mario and Charles in the 1930’s, MarBorg has continued to be on the forefront of recycling technology. Through continued investment and innovation MarBorg has steadily increased the amount of material that they are able to process and recycle to 200,000 tons per year. Because of this continued effort and investment, MarBorg has become the largest private source of recycling for the Cities of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Buellton, UCSB and the County of Santa Barbara.

["directors-message-2020.html", "Chapter 1 Director’s Message 2020", " Chapter 1 Director’s Message 2020 Everything was going so well until…COVID-19. The recovery since the Great Recession was the longest expansion in our history, lasting about ten years. Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research declared the recovery was over in February, 2020, meaning the US entered a recession as of February, 2020. The economic data released since February dwarf anything ever seen in economic data. The pandemic led many governments around the world to react in similar ways, by shutting down large sectors of economic activity, though often with different timing. While government lockdowns can occur with the stroke of a pen, governments will not be able to force workers or consumers to restore their lives with a similar stroke of the pen. That is, both producers and consumers will decide on their own when they feel safe to return to normality. The main question on the minds of many is will the recovery from the pandemic be “V-shaped” or will the economy rebound slowly, “U-shaped” or erratically, say “W-shaped” or some other letter? The early effects on the labor market were catastrophic. The depth and suddeness are easily shown yet hard to comprehend. The first thing that happened during the lockdown was a loss of jobs in sectors deemed “non-essential,” such as retail, bars, restaurants, gyms, and so on. The shutdown led job losers to contact their state’s employment department to make an initial claim for unemployment insurance. Not all who apply are qualified, however, and so are unable to receive unemployment insurance. Yet, there were tens of millions who made claims for unemployment compensation over the past few months. Initial claims in Santa Barbara County typically averaged between 400-600 per week before the pandemic. On March 28 there were 11,135 initial claims followed by 9,589 the following week. The initial claims for unemployment in Santa Barbara County also jumped into never-before-seen territory. Here are the recent numbers, January: 2,522, February: 1,469, March: 17,246 and April: 22,262. The March and April numbers were more than ten times their typical average. The April number indicates that of the roughly 200,000 employed in March, 11% of them made initial claims for unemployment insurance. To understand the magnitude of the effect of the pandemic, note that employment in Leisure and Hospitality and Retail combined in April was about 33,000. Unemployed persons who received unemployment insurance and remained unemployed for the subsequent week can apply for additional unemployment insurance and enter the category called “continued claims.” It is clear that the unprecedented claims overwhelmed many state systems with California being the first to ask for Federal assistance. The devastation was felt in nearly every sector with some sectors hit harder than others. Workers in restaurants, bars and retail establishments were among the hardest hit. However, as these sectors began to open many of the workers were able to rejoin quite quickly. The graphs below highlight the massive decline and the beginnings of a recovery and, for some, looks V-like. Retail sales fell precipitously as did employment in that sector. In Santa Barbara, employment in the Leisure and Hospitality sector fell 40% between March and April. While Retail Trade saw a 7.5% overall decline in employment the Clothing and Clothing Accessories Stores component fell 44%. We are in the midst of a major pandemic with no real end in sight. The impacts have been devastating. The government mandated shutdowns have hit nearly every sector of our economy. Policy responses have been massive. CARES and PPP have sent trillions of dollars to many of those affected. It is not clear at this point how much more will be needed to keep those in need afloat. "],
["snap.html", "Chapter 2 Industry Snapshot 2.1 Local Finance 2.2 Oil and Gas 2.3 Agriculture", " Chapter 2 Industry Snapshot 2.1 Local Finance Key Points: Large banks experienced a slight increase in deposits as a percentage of liabilities with 73% at the end of 2019 compared with 69% at the end of 2018. In 2019, small banks continued their exponential growth in net income, currently 34% higher than in 2018. For the first time since 2012-2013, both small and large banks exceeded their pre-recession levels for return on assets. FDIC Call Reports are released for all banks in the U.S., providing financial statement information to the public that is otherwise unavailable for private companies. The Local Finance section reports and analyzes banks that have a presence in Santa Barbara County. Using the data from FDIC Summary of Deposits, we examine each bank’s activity and health on a local level. For banks with an international presence, we are not able to factor out their international operations due to limitations in the data provided by the FDIC Call Reports. Therefore, 6 out of the 19 institutions have an aggregated total of both domestic and foreign operations for their assets and liabilities. The difference makes up about 4% of the total – which does not materially change the analysis on a local level. In this section, we have two categories: large banks and small banks. Large banks are banks that operate on both regional and national levels; whereas, small banks are comprised of solely regional banks and banks with less than $2 billion in total assets. Big banks in this year’s data include Rabobank, Union Bank, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, First Republic Bank, Bank of the West, The Northern Trust Company, Pacific Western Bank, U.S. Bank, Citizens Business Bank, First Bank, and Banc of California. For our analysis on small banks, we have included American Riviera Bank, Community West Bank, Pacific Premier Bank, Montecito Bank &amp; Trust, Community Bank of Santa Maria, Bank of the Sierra, and Farmers and Merchants Bank of Long Beach. The data in this section has been adjusted for inflation; therefore, all numbers in the section are in terms of 2009 dollars. Nominal numbers have been adjusted to real numbers on a quarterly basis with the CPI from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, giving us a more accurate look at banking trends, particularly in times of large price movements. 2.1.1 Savings and Time Deposits Deposits held by banks represent the vast majority of liabilities for both categories. At the end of 2019, large regional banks held 73% of their total liabilities as deposits, a small increase from 69% of their total liabilities in 2018. On the other hand, small regional banks held 87% of their total liabilities as domestic deposits, which has remained constant since the end of 2018. Since deposits represent such a large percentage of total liabilities, it is important to understand the trends within each bank category in order to understand where consumers are depositing money. Small and large banks display similar trends in terms of deposits as a percentage of total liabilities. Until this year, large banks had been steadily increasing their deposits as a percent of total liabilities over the past few years, whereas small banks have been more volatile. Since the Great Recession, both small and large banks have increased their percent of deposits as a fraction of liabilities. The growth for small regional banks occurred earlier in our data sample, peaking at 87% in 2010, and again at the end of 2019, 14% higher than at the end of 2007. At the end of 2019, large banks saw their highest percentage at 73%, 18% higher than it was at the end of 2007. In 2019, the banking industry in Santa Barbara County consisted of 20 institutions with over $12 billion in deposits. Compared with last year, there was a decrease of -0.53% in deposits with an increase in the number of banks. The numbers in the table below are in nominal terms since the change in CPI from 2018 to 2019 was small, making the deposits relatively comparable. First Republic Bank experienced the largest increase in deposits of 16.7%; although, they remained in the same position in terms of market share. US Bank had the largest decline in deposits, falling from $57,631,000 to $47,051,000 or -18.36%. Consequently, it dropped one place in terms of market share. As banks know when their deposits will be measured every year, we cannot rule out some level of manipulation of deposits that leads to large fluctuations. 2.1.2 The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a commonly used measure of industry concentration. Ranging from 0 to 1, the HHI is found by summing the squared market shares of all the firms. When the HHI is 0, a market has a large number of equally sized firms; on the other hand, when the HHI is 1, a market has only one firm. According to the Department of Justice, any market with a HHI between 0.15 and 0.25 is considered to be moderately concentrated. When a market exceeds 0.25, the Department of Justice finds it to be a concentrated market, which may require further review before any mergers can occur. For Santa Barbara County, the current HHI is 0.1067. Therefore, the current banking industry in Santa Barbara is un-concentrated. The HHI for the County decreased by 4.1% compared with last year’s HHI of 0.1113. 2.1.3 Loans and Leases In the past year, loans and leases appear to be trending upwards for large banks while the annual growth for small banks experienced a small decline. The average quarterly growth rate for large banks in 2019 was 5%, which is a big increase in comparison to .43% in 2018. Since the first quarter of 2007, the average quarterly rate of loans and leases for large banks has been 1.58%. In 2019, small banks saw an average quarterly decline of -0.41%, lower than their growth rate in 2018, which was 7%. Additionally, final quarter numbers were 1.2% lower in 2019 than in 2018, ending the increasing trend of loans and leases from 2014 to 2018. For small banks, the average quarterly growth rate of loans and leases since 2007 is 8%. 2.1.4 Net Income Real net income has increased by 34% for small banks over the past year, surpassing 2018’s net income figure as the highest value over the last decade, recovering tremendously after years of 2009 and 2010 which saw negative values. For large banks, net income increased slightly by 3.8%, continuing the upward trend of the past few years. Since the collapse of the financial markets in 2008, banks have experienced a healthy rebound. Although, simply looking at the value of net income does not account for the increase in the size of many banks. In order to take this into account, we divide net income by assets to calculate each bank’s Return on Assets (ROA). The ROA graph demonstrates the banks’ average return on assets this year compared with their average 2007 levels. By measuring this variable we can see that in 2019, both small and large banks have surpassed their pre-recession levels. In 2013, the total return on assets for both large and small banks declined, but there appears to be a robust rebound. Currently, large banks stand 7% higher than 2007 average return on assets while small banks are now at 38% higher than 2007 levels. 2.2 Oil and Gas Key Points: California’s production of crude oil has been declining since the late 1980’s and dropped another 2.4% between 2017 and 2018. Onshore state gas production was the only category of gas or oil production that increased in 2018. California’s field production of crude oil has been decreasing every year since 2014. Oil production decreased at a higher annual rate in 2019 at 4.5 percent compared to the decrease in oil production in 2018, about 2.5 percent. In 2016, the rate of production increased from 1.7 percent in 2015 to 7.5 percent. In addition, oil prices have been fluctuating steadily since 2017 after a significant decrease in prices in 2016. Oil prices grew steadily through 2018, but dipped slightly upon entering 2019. The price for WTI-Texas for oil ended at $60.46 per barrel in 2017, whereas the ending price for oil was $61.14 per barrel in 2019. Data for 2020 is still incomplete, but the existing data through February 2020 suggests decreasing prices in oil, ending at $49.78 on February 25, 2020. 2.2.1 Oil Production Onshore oil production has decreased to 3,494,000 BBL in 2018. Oil production has been fluctuating since 1996, reached a maximum in 2017 of 3,752,000 BBL and reached a minimum of 1,914,000 BBL in 2005. Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2013 and 2014, however, it began to look as if an upward trend was emerging in onshore oil production as it increased by 9.9% and 12.8% in those two years. Oil production dropped significantly by 22% in 2015 to end the increasing trend in 2014. In 2018, state offshore oil production has remained at zero for the third consecutive year. Federal oil production has fallen by 14.68% since 2017. The decrease in federal production of 4.87 million barrels compared with 59 million barrels in 1996. Starting in 2016, California has ceased all offshore production of oil. The amount of oil production is the second smallest in the data recorded, after 3.2 million barrels in 2016. 2.2.2 Gas Production Offshore gas production by the federal government decreased by 522 barrels from 2017 to 2018. The total production of federal offshore production has been decreasing since 2014, and the largest decrease in federal offshore gas production occurred between 2014 and 2015, when production fell by about 48 percent. Since then, offshore gas production has been decreasing steadily, but at lower rates. In addition, offshore gas production by the state has stopped altogether for the first time in the data measured. Only onshore state gas production increased in 2018 in Santa Barbara County. Gas production increased by 135,000 barrels, which is a 5.6% increase since 2017. Onshore production of gas makes up a majority of all gas production in Santa Barbara, constituting roughly 63% of total gas production. Offshore oil and gas production in the County is broken down between state and federal production. In 2018, offshore state oil production stayed at 0 barrels for the third consecutive year, while offshore state gas production fell from 1.84 MMCF to no production. This is the first-time state offshore gas production has stopped in the recorded data. 2.3 Agriculture Key Points Total crop value decreased 4.3%, from $1.59 billion to $1.52 billion. The total value of broccoli, the county’s fifth-highest grossing crop, decreased by 49.4%, falling from $158.7 million to $80.3 million. Wine grapes become the second-highest grossing crop in the county, with total sales of $121.3 million. 2.3.1 Total Crop Production The total crop value in 2018 was $1.52 billion, a decline of 4.3% from the prior year. This represents a stark break from the previous year, when the total crop value increased by 11.5%. A drastic fall in total harvested acreage of approximately 27% over the past year likely attributed to this marked difference. 2.3.2 Leading Crops Production of strawberries, the county’s highest-grossing crop for the past 20 years, had a gross value of $479 million. This represents a 4.7% increase in gross value of strawberry crops from 2017, which was $457 million. Though the value of the crop has increased since, the growth in gross value of the crop has slowed since 2017, when the value of strawberry crops increased by a whopping 10.4%. The decline in growth of gross value over the past year can likely be explained by the approximate 27% decrease in harvested acreage. Prior to 2017, the gross value of the strawberry crop had been decreasing for a couple of years. Broccoli’s crop value fell drastically in 2018, decreasing from $158.7 million the previous year to $80.3 million. The 49.4% decline in gross value meant that the broccoli crop became the fifth highest grossing crop, falling from its perch at second in 2017. A 50.4% and 18.7% decrease in harvested acreage and price, respectively, explains the decline in crop value for broccoli. However, despite these trends, 2018 had a 25.6% higher yield per acre for broccoli than 2017. The wine grape crop’s value fell by almost 17% from 2017 to 2018, going from $146.1 million to $121.3 million. Despite the fall in gross value, the wine grape crop rose to second highest grossing crop from its place at third in 2017. The price rose, but enough to mitigate the effects of the large decline in harvested acreage and total production for all wine grapes. The price increased by 9.97%, while total production and harvested acreage of wine grapes fell by 18.7% and 25.1%, respectively. The avocado crop had a tough year in 2017—total crop value fell by 39.2% from 2016—but bounced back in 2018. Total crop value rose from $38.6 million to $52.6 million, resulting in an increase of 36.3%. This spike in crop value is due in part to an increase in yield per acre, which helped to facilitate a drastic increase in the total production of avocados. In 2018, yield per acre rose from 2.46 to 4.56, and total production simultaneously rose from 10,494 to 22,497, which translates to a 114.4% increase. Harvested acreage also rose for the avocado crop in 2018, which was likely another contributing factor for the hike in total production; harvested acreage increased by 15.6%. 2.3.3 Wine Grape Production In California, the average price of all grape varieties in 2018 was $831.63 per ton, 6.8% higher from the previous year. In District 8, the wine region consisting of the Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo counties, the average price of all varieties was $1670 per ton, which is significantly higher than the state average. The price in District 8 fell from 2017 by 3.9%, while the total tons of grapes crushed rose from 233,228 to 245,512. Santa Barbara is best known for its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, the former of which experienced a price increase of 0.7%, and the latter of which faced a 5.4% decrease in price. For the last three years, Cabernet Sauvignon has been the most heavily processed variety; it experienced a 13.2% increase in tons crushed and an 8.2% decrease in price over the past year. 2.3.4 Drought Recovery Since the end of January of 2019, California has no longer been in a state of Severe Drought, according to the USDA’s five-point drought rating. For a large part of 2019, around 6% of California was Abnormally Dry. From August to December of 2019, about 2% of the state was in a Moderate Drought. In October and November, there was a large spike in the percentage of the state that was Abnormally Dry—for a great deal of November, about 80% of the state was considered Abnormally Dry. However, rainfall in December helped to bring this level down drastically, so that only approximately 3.5% of the state was Abnormally Dry by the end of the year. For most of the year, California did not experience a drought, and the periods that it did were short-lived and alleviated by rainfall. In Santa Barbara County, the city council was able to rescind the Stage Three Drought Emergency in April 2019 due to increased rainfall; however, conservation remains vital in order to preserve water for potential dry spells in the future. The winter of 2019 brought above-average rainfall, which helped alleviate the county’s seven-year drought. Forecasts show that the water supply in Santa Barbara will be able to last through 2021. "],
["rot.html", "Chapter 3 COVID-19 3.1 Demographics 3.2 Foot Traffic 3.3 Unemployment and Employment Projections 3.4 Individual and Statewide Debt", " Chapter 3 COVID-19 COVID-19 has been an unprecedented event in US (and world) history. Given the ongoing nature of this worldwide pandemic, what we include below is certainly not final. Instead, we hope to highlight some of the impacts of COVID-19 to promote community discussion about how to best move forward. 3.1 Demographics While we can not yet be sure of the long term effects of COVID-19, two things are clear: Individuals with comorbidities are most at risk Social distancing works. The corollary to these two facts is that the elderly who tend to have weaker immune systems or existing medical conditions and those who cannot effectively social distance are particularly at risk. Related to these concerns is the fact that low income individuals are also those most likely to have experienced economic insecurity as a result of weakening labor markets during the pandemic. Moreover, similar to the elderly, those of low socioeconomic status are more likely to experience comorbidities and have higher mortality rates. But how old exactly are Santa Barbara County residents? How many individuals cannot effectively socially distance? Where do our most vulnerable live? The age distribution of Santa Barbara County is shown in the table below. Evidently, the age mix of Santa Barbara County residents has remained largely unchanged over the past 5 years. The estimated median age of individuals in the county is approximately 34 years of age, roughly 4 years below that of the United States as a whole. Despite this fact, a substantial fraction of the Santa Barbara County population is at elevated risk during the pandemic as a result of old age. In fact, those aged 65+ make up 15.6% of our population. According to the Center for Disease Control, estimates that approximately 8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths reported in the United States have come from this population. The population density, and in particular the number of persons per household, is also key to understanding how any disease outbreak is likely to affect our communities. Even with strict adherence to guidelines aimed at controlling the spread of disease, e.g. social distancing, it is difficult for some in our community to adhere to such recommendations. A potential consequence of a high number of persons per household is that diseases have a greater potential to spread as result of weekly shopping trips, going to work, etc. The graph below displays the distribution of household size for both North and South County While both regions of Santa Barbara County have a high number of one and two person households, North County has substantially more high-density households than does South County. In fact, households containing more than four persons make up 22% of households in North County whereas they make up only 11.6% of households in South County. Of particular note is the relatively high number of 7+ person households in North County. While the poorest among us are more likely to live in high density housing environments, the Office of Disease and Health Promotion consistently finds that those of low socioeconomic status tend to experience higher rates of heart disease and diabetes, have higher rates of disability, and maintain higher mortality rates. Identifying those in our community that suffer from these comorbidities is of first order importance when managing the health risk of disease outbreaks. The graph below shows the distribution of household income in North and South County. It also displays in red the income groups for which all members are below the federal poverty line for a household consisting of four individuals. As of January 15, 2020, the federal poverty line in use by the Department of Health and Human Services for such households is $26,200. This cutoff represents an underestimate of those who are financially constrained in high cost of living areas. Both regions have roughly the same number of impoverished households as defined here. Evidently, however, North County has significantly fewer high income households relative to South County, with a much larger drop off following the modal income group of $50,000-$75,000. 3.2 Foot Traffic While demographic data informs who in our community are most at risk during disease outbreaks, it does not provide the full picture of those affected. The daily activities of people across the United States have fundamentally change due to COVID-19, both by choice and because of local, state, and federal policies. As a result, business have faced an unprecedented demand shock for which many were unprepared. The effect of the pandemic on businesses has first order consequences for individual employment and income. Moreover, to the extent that the businesses close their doors for good, the effect of COVID-19 on the demand for goods and services will contribute to the long-run, persistent effect of the pandemic on our community. Santa Barbara City, for example, is known as a year-round tourist and has many hotels, motels—including the original Motel 6—museums, parks, and other tourist destinations. Beginning in March 2020, however, the number of visits per week to such attractions saw large declines. Interestingly, nature parks saw a small spike in foot traffic immediately following the statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19th. Presumably, this spike reflects the fact that individuals were adjusting to the “new normal” in addition to a desire to return to the outdoors after a week of remaining stuck indoors. In fact, Elings Park and Shoreline Park, two of the most popular parks in Santa Barbara, both saw spikes in foot traffic the week of March 30th when the Zoo and local museums remained closed. In addition to beaches and parks, many tourists come to Santa Barbara County to visit wine tasting rooms and microbreweries. Breweries, wineries, and beer, wine, and liquor stores have all seen large declines in foot traffic. This trend is apparent both in Santa Barbara City and the County as a whole. The decline, however, is much sharper for the County as a whole than Santa Barbara City. The changes in locations that people are visiting can be visualized by matching foot traffic data to census blocks. We accomplish this in the graph below. Map areas without shading are census blocks with no registered points of interest or with zero visitors in either the month of February or March. Apparently, some outdoor areas actually experienced increases in the number of visitors in march. More Mesa, San Miguel Open Space, and residential areas on the Mesa saw some of the largest increases in foot traffic. Isla Vista, State Street, local schools, colleges, and universities, and the funk zone saw dramatic declines. This broad trend is likely true throughout most cities in Santa Barbara County: retail, dinning, and largely student occupied areas have received very few visitors while outdoor parks and trails have seen a rise in the number of visitors. [Insert png version of interactive foot traffic map] In fact, foot traffic in dining services fell be roughly 75% County wide leading up to the statewide shelter-in-place order. Such establishments have continued to see a decline in visitors thereafter. Take out and fast food services experienced similar declines. Not surprisingly, food and health supplement stores saw an increase in foot traffic in early March, with GNC accounting for a large portion of that increase. Following shelter-in-place orders, however, even these business experienced a decline in foot traffic. Movie theaters on the other hand experience a decline in foot traffic even before closures due to shelter-in-place orders. Several other establishments also experienced spikes in foot traffic at the start of the crises. Costco, Whole Foods, and other major grocery outlets experienced large increases leading up to the shelter-in-place orders. This data likely reflects the fact that many individuals sought so “stock up” on food and essentials upon learning of the seriousness of the pandemic. Similarly, Home Depot saw a spike in foot traffic the week following the statewide shelter-in-place order. While we cannot be sure, this is likely indicative of the fact that individuals began tackling outstanding “at home” projects now that they were spending substantially more time inside. 3.3 Unemployment and Employment Projections Some of the economic effects suggested by the foot traffic data above have already borne out in other data sources. Of concern are the effects of COVID-19 on employment in the US. Predictions of the future unemployment rate have ranged widely in different reports. The unemployment rate had previously reached a half century low of 3.5%. However, early on during the pandemic, some economists predicted that it could reach above 15%. Taking a more dire outlook, the St. Louis Federal Reserve bank suggested this slowdown could cost 47 million jobs leading to a jobless rate around 32%. What do these numbers mean for Santa Barbara, and what do they mean for the Tricounty area more generally? A striking piece of data that illuminates the harmful effects on the local economy is the number of initial unemployment insurance claims filed in the past few months. Below are the most recent 5 weeks of initial claims along with the level of continued claims for California: EFP has constructed its own estimates of projected job losses for California, Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County. The different aggregate projections by the Economic Policy Institute and St. Louis Fed underpin the predictions. First, two separate scenarios are used: the “Private share” and “Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail share” approaches. The former assumes that all the projected job losses are uniformly distributed across industries. The second approach assumes that all job losses are concentrated in the Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail sectors. However, the true levels of future unemployment likely lie somewhere in the middle. As such, both models are weighted equally so the results serve as a reasonably conservative estimate of projected job losses. Quantity results are largely inelastic to changes in the weight scheme. Finally, the raw losses are translated into unemployment rate figures for Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Using numbers from the reference month, we calculate the effect on the unemployment rate if 0 to 50,000 additional jobs are lost. Technically this assumes that all lost jobs are by those who live in-county, but this assumption is likely unimportant quantitatively. In the graph below we see that as more individuals lose jobs, the higher is the associated unemployment rate. At 0 job losses–where each line crosses the y-axis–we recover the reference month’s unemployment rate (i.e. the rate we have most recently observed). The differences in the slopes of each line reflect differences in the base population. For example, a loss of 50,000 jobs in Ventura would indeed be painful, but would be devastating to San Luis Obispo county. The dotted lines indicate where our numbers above fall into this graph. The baseline (not seasonally adjusted) employment level for the various regions and sectors are also reported for reference. The following prediction makes use of aggregate projections by the Economic Policy Insitute which predict a private sector contraction of 19.8 million jobs by the summer. EPI disaggregates this national figure by state; EFP follows a similar procedure to uncover county-level numbers. The following graph uses the St. Louis Fed’s forecast of 47 million lost jobs: 3.4 Individual and Statewide Debt One of the lesser recognized channels through which COVID-19, and disease outbreaks more broadly, affect members of our community is through individual and collective debt obligations. With unemployment at record highs, it will be difficult for many individuals to pay their debt obligations. Moreover, because many businesses are struggling, it is not clear that unemployment will decrease sharply as our economy slowly reopens. As a result of the unprecedented financial strain on both individuals and businesses, the risk of systemic default has risen. Furthermore, the lower employment levels, depressed incomes, and fewer operating businesses will also result in decreased tax revenue for local, state, and federal governments. Combined with already high levels of public debt and new economic stimulus, it will be challenging for governments to balance budgets. As a result, it is likely that at least some of the economic burden of this crises will be passed on to future generations and an indirect effect of COVID-19 that is likely to persist for many years. But just how substantial were debt obligations leading up to the pandemic? The graph below shows total federal government debt Prior to the pandemic, federal debt quadrupled since 2000. Reaching over $20 trillion dollars. It is possible to break down debt both to a more local level and by type of debt. Much of readily available data is limited to the State level. The graph below shows revolving debt, which primarily consists of credit card debt, for both the California and the United States as a whole. The average amount of revolving debt held by individuals in the U.S. and California peaked during the Great Recession an subsequently fell sharply. Since 2013, it has steadily risen. As of 2019, revolving debt in California reached $3,810 per person while that in the United States reached $3,390 per person. One of the largest categories of debt held by individuals is mortgage debt. Outstanding mortgage debt per capita has become a key statistic in assessing the risk of systemic default following the Great Recession, particularly when labor markets are weak or individual incomes are depressed. As for revolving debt, mortgage debt per capita peaked in 2008 and subsequently fell. In 2019, mortgage debt per capita in California and the United States rose to $57,170 and $34,790, respectively. Still, both remain below their respective peaks of $70,100 and $38,490. A key concern for many college educated individuals is their sometimes high levels of student loan debt. This is particularly true of both current and recent graduates who payed for higher education through loans with the expectation that they would enter a robust labor market. The graph below shows that student loans among the population have risen sharply over the past 15 years, increasing by more than a factor of 5. In 2019, student loan debt per capita in both California and the United States reached peaks of $4,640 and $5,510, respectively. These high levels of student loan debt directly effect the spending behavior of individuals, particularly when they are financially constrained due to lack of employment. From the perspective of state and local governments, one of the key challenges to balancing budgets is the need to fund pension systems. Three of the largest pension funds that affect our local community are calPERS, calTeachers, and UCRP. The graph below displays reported total pension liabilities and the percent of liabilities that are unfunded. Because only a small fraction of calPERS is required to follow all reporting guidelines necessary for our analysis, the calPERS data represents only a part of the full calPERS pension fund. Still, we view this data as qualitatively indicative of the program as a whole. The reported total pension liabilities by of each pension fund Is $139 billion, $329 billion, and $88 billion, respectively. Each of these funds reports an unfunded ratio, i.e. fraction of liabilities for which there are insufficient fund assets, of 28%, 27%, and 21%, respectively. The liabilities data reported by pension funds, including those graphed above, while informative are misleading. In particular, annual financial reports produced by pension funds follow what are known as the GASB 67 guidelines. A crucial assumption necessary to calculate total pension liabilities is the assumed return of fund assets. The higher the assumed rate of return, the lower the total pension liabilities will be. The GASB 67 guidelines give funds wide latitude to set their assumed rate of return. The reported data used to construct the previous figure all assume an annual rate of return above 7%. This, however, is misguided as such a rate of return requires investment in risky assets. The key flaw in these assumptions is that funds are allowed to implicitly assume that the assets and liabilities of the fund are equally as risky. This is not necessarily the case. The graphs below show the portfolio allocation of each pension fund. The asset mix of all three funds is heavily titled toward equities, which tend to be higher risk assets, as opposed to fixed income. Pension liabilities, on the other hand, are much more certain, i.e. less risky, than suggested by the asset mix of these funds. To provide both a more conservative picture of the health of pension funds and one that treats pension liabilities as more certain (less risky), pension fund liabilities should be computed using, for example, risk free rates of return. One commonly used measure of the risk free rate of return is the return on 10 year treasury bonds. The graph below shows the position of these three pension funds using a risk free rate of 2.0%. The difference between the data reported and that implied by a risk free rate is quite stark. The total liabilities and unfunded ratio of each fund roughly doubles. While both the reported data and adjusted data presented below highlight the difficulty of funding these pension systems, the adjusted data shows that substantially more work must be done to balance budgets than may be recognized by local governments.

The Finance and Insurance industry was the largest contributor to Real GDP in Santa Barbara. This industry was the second largest contributor in 2017, while the largest was Government. Company Management was the fastest increasing industry in 2018, with an increase in GDP contribution of 41.8%. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the value of all goods and services produced within a certain location over a certain period of time. It remains one of the best measures of economic growth and well-being, not only for the nation but also for local areas. Unlike the data on national GDP, data on GDP for Santa Barbara County is only reported annually and at a considerable lag. Typically, we rely on alternative measures to judge the health of our local economy like employment statistics and housing prices, which are released more frequently. However, GDP remains a relevant statistic to determine long-run trends in the county’s economic growth and industry mix. It also allows for a direct comparison to growth in the nation and state. Real GDP growth in Santa Barbara County for 2018 was 3.7%. This marks two consecutive years of increasing GDP, as 2017 real GDP in Santa Barbara County increased by 2.9%. From 2008 to 2018, eight years have seen growth, with the largest increase being 7.2% in 2015. U.S real GDP increased by 2.5% in 2018 and has had upward growth for nine consecutive years, starting in 2010. Real GDP rose in California by 4.25% in 2018, slightly lower than the increase of 4.4% in 2017. Real GDP increased by 2.5% in 2018 for San Luis Obispo. From 2010 to 2018, San Luis Obispo has had nine consecutive years of positive real GDP growth rates. Similar to Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo experienced its highest growth rate of the past 10 years in 2015, at an increase of 6.3% in 2015. Ventura County experienced a 1.3% increase in real GDP in 2018. Ventura County has had growth since 2013; however, the growth rate has been consistently decreasing since 2015, with an average decrease of 0.7%. Industry Growth The largest five industries in 2018 were Finance, Real Estate, Manufacturing, Government, and Professional &amp; Business Services, in that order. Four of these five industries were also part of the five largest industries in 2017—Manufacturing is now the third largest industry compared to Trade in 2017. Finance was the second largest industry in 2017, trailing Government by a margin of $480 million. However, in 2018, Government was the fourth largest industry, trailing Finance by $1,087 million. The fastest growing industry in 2018 was Company Management, which experienced GDP growth of 41.8% from 2017. Companies that fall into this industry are those whose roles include holding securities of other companies in order to influence management, administration and management services, as well as strategic or organizational planning and decision-making. The second-fastest growing industry in Santa Barbara County was Utilities, with GDP growth of 18.3%. Mining had the largest growth rate in 2017, at 55.1%, while in 2018 this industry had the fourth largest growth rate of 13.4%. This illustrates the volatility and cyclicality of the Mining industry. Total Farm had the third largest growth rate in 2018 at 16.2%, and Professional and Business Services had the fifth largest growth rate at 10.2%. The five industries with the weakest growth in 2018 were Information (-5.5%), Arts (-4.1%), Manufacturing (-1%), Construction (0.2%), and Finance (0.5%). From 2017 to 2018, there was no continuity in industries that experienced weakest growth. It is interesting to note that, even though Finance and Manufacturing were the first and third largest contributors to real GDP in Santa Barbara, they experienced the fifth and third weakest growth in GDP at 0.5% and -1%, respectively.

This marks a significant improvement from the previous year of 2017, when the county’s ranking was 159. The MSA with the highest per capita GDP growth was Midland, TX at 21.9%, while the MSA with the lowest was Farmington, NM. 4.2 Prices Key Points: Core inflation, which removes the effects of energy and food prices, increased by 2.19% from 2018 to 2019 in the United States, and by 3.07% in the Los Angeles Area. For the third year in a row, the Los Angeles Area CPI increased by more than 2.0%, the long-term inflation target. The main measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This index is calculated by taking the change in prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed basket of goods and services, which is representative of what a typical consumer purchases. In 2019, the CPI for the Los Angeles Area increased by 3.07%. This is higher than the overall U.S. inflation in 2019 of 1.81%. Core CPI is often thought of as the best measure of inflation. It resolves issues and concerns regarding volatility by removing food and energy from the basket of goods and services. By this measure, inflation was 3.07% in the Los Angeles area for 2019, which is similar to the value of change in standard CPI—only 7.3% higher than the inflation rate calculated using standard CPI measure. The core CPI value for Los Angeles was 5.23% higher than the value for the US in 2019. Los Angeles has consistently had a higher core CPI than the US for the last several years. The FED hit their long-term inflation target of 2.0% for the first time in 2016 since 2008. The inflation rate increased drastically in 2019 for Los Angeles, hitting high above the FED’s target. However, it did not increase as much in comparison with the previous year, when the inflation rate in Los Angeles was 3.15%. The FED achieved their 2.0% benchmark in 2019 with the core CPI for the U.S. being slightly above their target. CPI for energy in the Los Angeles Area increased by 3.44% in 2019, while U.S. energy CPI decreased by 2.11%. 4.2.1 Monetary Policy After about seven years of the effective fed funds rate remaining near zero, the Fed finally started the process of raising rates, or “liftoff,” in December 2015, raising the target range for the overnight funds rate from 0%-0.25% to 0.25%-0.50%. They continued this process and raised the target range by another quarter-point to 0.50%-0.75% in December 2016, to 1.25%-1.50% in December 2017, 1.50%-1.75% in March 2018, and to 2.25%-2.50% in December 2018. However, in 2019, the Fed started to lower the range for the overnight funds rate from 2%-2.25% in August, from 1.75%-2.00% in September, and most recently, from 1.50%-1.75% in October. The Taylor Rule, a monetary-policy “rule” that suggests the nominal interest rate be set in response to changes in inflation and output, has decreased in 2019. This is due to the inflation rate being below the Fed’s target level of 2%. Currently, the Taylor Rule suggests nominal interest rates should be about 3-4%. Going forward, if the Taylor Rule is any indication, the fed funds rate should continue to decrease. 4.3 Retail Sales Key Points Retail sales growth continued its steady climb throughout the entirety of 2017 at an average growth rate of 0.49% every quarter. With 20.06% of total taxable sales, Food Services and Drinking Places remained the largest industry in the county. Buellton had the largest one-year growth in total sales of 10.3%, and Carpentaria had the largest one-year decline in growth of -7.05%. Retail sales grew throughout 2017. The annualized growth rates by quarter were 0.23%, 0.66%, 0.61%, and 0.47%, respectively. The 4-quarter moving average for retail sales in the county remained steady, slightly increasing throughout the year. Overall, growth was stronger than in 2016: average quarterly growth was 0.49%, compared to 0.28% in 2016. Disaggregated by industry, the top two industries (excluding Other Retail Group) by percentage of total sales was represented by Food Services and Drinking Places at the top with 20.06% of sales, followed by Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers at 19.14%.

Five counties experienced decreases in total sales from 2016 to 2017: Alpine, Modoc, Kings, Trinity, and Kern counties. Three cities within Santa Barbara County decreased in total sales. Carpentaria decreased by 7.04%, Santa Barbara City by 1.69%, and Goleta by 0.66%. Buellton showed impressive growth of 10.33%, the highest in the county. Although Buellton had highest overall retail sales growth, it wasn’t the highest in sales growth per capita. Lompoc grew 9.12% in per capita sales, while Guadalupe grew 7.52%. In Buellton, the taxable sales per capita stands at $40,274, or 256% of the country average of $15,752, while in Guadalupe the taxable sales per capita is only $4,531 or 28.76% of the county average. This is a massive difference within the same county, with Buellton’s taxable sales per capita at almost nine times that of Guadalupe. "],

Buellton has the lowest unemployment rate in the county at 1.17% and Santa Maria has the highest unemployment rate in the county at 5.64%. 5.1.1 Santa Barbara County Employment Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries continued to grow in 2019. Total Employment increased from 208,144 jobs in October 2018 to 211,691 jobs in October 2019. This gain of 3,547 workers represents an increase of 1.7%, which is higher than last year’s growth rate of 1.17%. Since December of 2012, Santa Barbara County has a net gain of 20,339 jobs, averaging an increase of 2,905 jobs each year. This is sign that the labor markets in Santa Barbara County are healthy. Nonfarm payroll in California increased in 2019, at a rate of 2.17%. This is slightly higher than the 2018 growth rate of 2%. Since December of 2012, nonfarm payrolls have increased in California by 18.3%. United States nonfarm payroll has also increased at a rate of 3.38%. This is slightly higher than the 2018 growth rate of 1.78%. Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll growth increased by 1.89%, which is slightly lower compared to California and the United States. This is higher than the 2018 growth rate of 1.16%. Nonfarm payroll is indexed to July 2009, and since the end of the recession, Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll gains (14.56%) have been lower than the Unites States’ (16.31%) and significantly lower than California’s (22.56%). The number of unemployed workers and the unemployment rate has also improved in the past year. The unemployment rate dropped from a peak of 10.0% in November 2010, to 3.8% in October 2018, and based on the most recent data, 3.5% in October 2019. The number unemployed, defined as workers who are without work and are actively seeking work, has declined from a peak of 21,445 in November 2010, to 8,253 in October 2018, and then down to 7,602 in October 2019. This drop of 651 unemployed workers in the past year represents a decline of 7.9%. The declines in both variables have been gradually slowing down as the labor market returns to so-called “full employment”, loosely defined as the lowest possible level that will not cause inflation. If unemployment falls significantly, inflation will rise as employers compete to hire workers and push up wages too fast. The size of the labor force in Santa Barbara County has decreased from October 2018 to October 2019 by 179 workers. This is a small decrease of less than .01%. Even though the decrease is minimal, it is important to note that Santa Barbara’s labor force is not growing significantly, even though unemployment continues to decrease. 5.1.2 Industry Data The next three figures show employment growth for 12 industries in Santa Barbara County over the past year, three years and ten years.

Other industries, like Manufacturing and Education and Health Services, have almost no seasonal component. Employment in Leisure and Hospitality, Education and Health Services, and Professional and Business Services are all enjoying upward trends over this period. Employment in Goods Producing and Manufacturing has also seen recent upward trends after realizing declines after the Recession. Employment in Retail Trade has been declining since peaking in 2015. 5.1.3 City Data Santa Barbara County is comprised of cities with diverse industry mixes and economic conditions. North County, which includes five cities (Buellton, Guadalupe, Lompoc, Santa Maria, and Solvang) and five census designated places (Los Alamos, Mission Hills, Orcutt, Santa Ynez, Vandenberg AFB, and Vandenberg Village), is typically poorer, has higher unemployment rates, and is more agricultural than South County. However, Buellton and Santa Ynez are exceptions to the first two of these differences. South County includes three cities (Carpinteria, Goleta, and Santa Barbara) and five census designated places (Isla Vista, Mission Canyon, Montecito, Summerland, and Toro Canyon). The following paragraphs will document differences in employment, unemployment rates, and industry mixes across cities. Current unemployment rates are highest in Santa Maria (6.63%), Lompoc (5.26%), Carpinteria (4.13%), and Guadalupe (3.71%). Unemployment rates are lowest in Buellton (1.5%) and Goleta (2.44%). Unemployment rates in the other cities in the county range between 2.69% to 2.72%. Unemployment rates in all areas have declined significantly since 2010, when several North County cities had unemployment rates around 12%. Industry employment differs substantially from city to city. We show the industry employment mix for each area in the figure on the next page.

Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp; Hunting is the largest industry based on employment in Santa Maria, with 30.1% employment in this one industry. 5.1.4 California Counties Labor markets all across California vary significantly as counties labor markets are dependent on their geographical region. Santa Barbara’s labor market compares well to most counties in California. However, they aren’t as strong as some counties in Northern California, and specifically those counties in the Bay Area. This section will provide some data and a map visualization to show how labor markets differ across California’s 58 counties. Santa Barbara’s unemployment rate (3.5%) is below California’s rate (3.9%). Santa Barbara has the 17th lowest unemployment rate between all California counties. The county with the lowest unemployment rate is San Mateo (1.8%), which is part of San Francisco’s Bay Area. The top five counties with the lowest unemployment are all from Northern California: San Mateo (1.8%), Marin (2.0%), San Francisco (2.0%), Santa Clara (2.3%), and Sonoma (2.4%). The three counties with the highest unemployment rate in the state are Imperial County (20.6%), Colusa County (10.5%), and Tulare County (8.5%). These counties also had the largest unemployment rates in 2018 as well. No other California counties have unemployment rates above 8%. Most California counties’ unemployment rates fall between 3.1% and 5.2%. Most California counties saw a decrease in their unemployment rate compared to 2018 levels. Colusa County saw the largest decrease in the unemployment rate (-1.37 percentage points) and Imperial County experienced the largest increase in the unemployment rate (2 percentage points). Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll grew by 1.3%, which is lower than California’s growth of 2%.

Only two counties had declines in nonfarm payrolls over the past year: Alpine County (-7.8%) and Solano County (-0.01%). Eleven counties saw nonfarm payroll grow over 3% annually. 5.1.5 Firm Size Data Since 2008, firm size distribution in Santa Barbara has remained relatively the same. In 2018, the most common number of employees at a firm in Santa Barbara is between 20-49 employees, and this has been unchanged since 2008. Even though it is still the most common number of employees, the proportion of firms with this range of employees has decrease from the 2008 level of 21.6% to 20.3% in 2018. Firms with 50-99 employees saw the greatest decline in firm size distribution since 2008. In 2008, firms with 50-99 employees accounted for 16.5% of firm size distribution, where in 2018; these firms only account 14.8% of firm size distribution. In 2018, firms with 500+ employees had the largest average payroll expenditure per employee at $16,047. Looking across all different firm sizes, we can see that payroll per employee has increase in every firm size category. The largest changes in payroll per employee were in firms with 250-499 employees and firms with 100-249 employees. These firms saw payroll per employee increases of 41.8% and 30% respectively.

We can also see that most Services employees work for firms with 20-49 employees (23.6%), which is larger than the Santa Barbara County average distribution of employees in firms of that size. Santa Barbara County’s firm size distribution difference between California’s is the proportion of workers in small businesses. For California, 54.8% of employees work in firms with less than 100 employees. The distribution is much larger in Santa Barbara County, where 65% of employees work in firms with less than 100 employees. Besides the difference in employee distribution in firms with less than 100 workers, Santa Barbara County and California’s firm size distribution are similar. The only major difference is in firms with 1000+ employees, as 14.5% of California employees work in firms of the largest size. Only 4% of Santa Barbara employees work in firms with 1000+ workers. 5.2 Employment Forecast Key Points: Nonfarm Payrolls are expected to grow at a rate of 1.04% in the upcoming year, an increase of 1,993 jobs. This suggests continued improvement at an decreasing rate from 2019. Our statistical forecast suggests a December 2020 unemployment rate of 3.10%, an increase of 0.25 percentage points. The 95% confidence interval spans from a low of 1.59% to a high of 4.62%. The forecasting methods used in this section are based on the Census Bureau’s X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Their program can be used to forecast a series using only its statistical features. Each employment series has a seasonal component (the December effect for retail trade is one example), a trend component (like the long-run downward trend in goods-producing industries or a multi-year recession), and an irregular component (a one-month bump or decline in the series for reasons that will not occur again, like the 2012 Olympics producing a one-month bump in the London economy). After decomposing a time-series into these three components, the current trend component and seasonal component can be used to forecast the series. While the irregular series cannot be predicted, since it has an expected value of zero, and systematic changes to the trend and seasonal components also cannot be predicted, the history of how these components have varied in the past can be used to generate confidence intervals. Each figure in this section shows the recent unadjusted and seasonally adjusted series followed by a three-year forecast. This forecast describes the most likely values for the unadjusted series. The dashed lines surrounding the forecast describe the 95% confidence interval. There is a 5% chance that values will occur outside of these dashed lines. Unless otherwise noted, each of the following year-over-year projections that we describe in the text will be between January 2018 and January 2019 for the unadjusted series. Total employment for all industries is projected to continue improving over the next three years. In 2019, our statistical forecast predicts a gain of 2,873 jobs (1.37%). This is slightly more growth than the respectable 1.16% seen in 2019. The 95% confidence interval includes a range of predictions of anywhere from a -2.7% decline to a 5.4% gain in the following year. Overall, in the next three years, we are expected to see average annual gains of 2,889 jobs per year and an average annual growth rate of 1.36 %. The unemployment rate over the next year is projected to continue its recent downward trend. Between December 2018 and December 2019, the unemployment rate declined by 0.4 percentage points. Our forecast predicts a further decline over the next year, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.10%, a decline of 0.30 percentage points between December 2019 and December 2020. The confidence interval includes possible unemployment rates between 1.59% and 4.62%. Among industries, the X-13 statistical forecast expects growth in a majority of the industries we depict in the following two pages. Of these industries, retail is expected to have the weakest performance, expecting to decline by 0.7%, and construction employment is expected to have the largest growth, increasing by 2.0%. The growth in farm is expected to continue in for the next three years, with an average annual growth rate of 1.98%. 5.3 Occupations The largest occupation in Santa Barbara County is Office and Administrative Support with 24,780 workers.

This group comprises 52% of the jobs in the county that have reported education and training requirements. The second largest education group is bachelor’s degree with no experience (24,730). Only 25.7% of jobs in the county require a bachelor’s degree or more. Recent employment projections, described in the 2019 Economic Forecast Project book, suggest that this employment composition will remain constant over the next ten years, with the vast majority of new jobs having minimal educational and training requirements. Among education groups, the jobs requiring a Doctoral or professional degree have the highest mean annual wage at $143,202. This is a change from the 2018 where jobs requiring a Bachelor’s degree with some work experience had the highest mean wages. For the most part, education &amp; training groups with more requirements pay more, except for postsecondary non-degree award jobs. High school or less with minimal training jobs pay the lowest mean annual wages ($32,714). This is 35% less than the second lowest education &amp; training group, high school or less with moderate training, and 64% less than the mean annual wage for a bachelor’s degree with no experience. In addition to providing data for individual occupations, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) also aggregates occupations into 22 occupation groups. A summary of the data for these occupation groups is provided in the following pages. Office and Administrative Support is the largest occupation group, with 24,780 jobs, and Food Preparation and Serving-Related Occupations is the second largest group, with 24,040 jobs. Food Preparation and Serving-Related Occupations saw a modest 8.1% employment increase in 2018. The occupation group that saw the largest increase in employment is the Construction and Extraction Occupations group. This group saw employment increase by 770 jobs, which is an 11.1% increase from 2017. Annual wages for the majority of occupations increased in 2018, with the exception of seven occupation groups. Community and Social Services Occupations had the largest wage increase of 10.1%. There was also strong growth in mean annual wage among Transportation and Moving Material Occupations, with a gain of 7.2%. The summary statistics table also displays the log 75-25 wage ratio. This represents the log of the ratio of the 75th percentile hourly wage within an occupation to the 25th percentile hourly wage. This is a commonly used measure of wage dispersion. Farming, fishing, and forestry has the lowest 75-25 ratio, at 0.08, meaning the majority of workers in this occupation earn a wage close to the mean wage of $12.96 per hour. The group with the most wage dispersion is Protective Services Occupations, which includes police officers, firefighters, and detectives, among other occupations. 5.4 Income Key Points: Real per capita income in Santa Barbara County rose in 2018 at 2.62%.

Per capita net earnings make up the majority of per capita personal income in the United States, California, and Santa Barbara. Per capita net earnings describe wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions to pensions and insurance funds), and proprietors’ income less contributions for government social insurance and an adjustment to convert earnings from place of work to place of resident. In California and the United States, this component represents about 64% and 63% of per capita income respectively. However, in Santa Barbara, this component only represents 57% of per capita income. The second largest factor in per capita income is formed by dividends, interest, and rent. Dividends, Interest, and rent made up 31% of Santa Barbara’s per capita income, 22% of California’s, and 21% in the United States in 2018. This difference can be attributed to Santa Barbara County’s unusually high income distribution; wealthier people typically earn a higher proportion of their income from investments, which produce dividends, interest, and rents, than lower-income people. Hourly wages in Santa Barbara grew nominally by 1.1%, from $26.70 to $26.99. Real wages for workers in community &amp; social services occupations and transportation occupations grew the fastest over the past year, with growth rates of 7.49% and 4.70% respectively. Within the county, management occupations experienced the largest real hourly wage decline from 2017 to 2018, losing 6.83%. This is a stark departure from the increasing trend over the previous 5 years. However, management occupations still had the highest real wages in 2018 at $54.37 per hour compared to the average across all occupations of $24.18. SiteReports provides the Economic Forecast Project with data to look at income distributions across Santa Barbara County. In 2020, the amount of families below the poverty line declined in Santa Barbara County from 8,909 to 7,929 for an 11% decrease. The number of families under the poverty line is disproportionally located in North County, which experienced an increase from 5,079 in 2019 to 5,475 in 2020. South County experienced a decrease in families under the poverty line by 278 families – 2,731 in 2019 to 2,453 in 2020. Across Santa Barbara county, changes in nominal median household income ranged from 16.35% in Buelton to 8.50% in Carpinteria. This growth in Buelton of about $12,702 puts their median income well above the median in Santa Barbara County. The County’s median income of $79,015 grew modestly by a net of $7,471 or a growth percentage of 10.44%. Consistent with prior years, Goleta has the highest median household income in Santa Barbara County at $104,565 and Lompoc has the lowest, at $56,298. "],
["housing.html", "Chapter 6 Real Estate 6.1 Residential 6.2 Commercial", " Chapter 6 Real Estate 6.1 Residential Real Estate Residential Real Estate Key Points: YoY growth in Santa Barbara County median home values experienced a U-shaped dip throughout 2019 and have since returned to values implied by its secular trend. The Santa Barbara County and Housing Affordability Index fell from 32% to 23% and once again sits below the average for all of California. The real median home price for Santa Barbara County rose by 6% in 2019 compared to a 3.4% increase in California. Residential building activity rebounded in 2019 to 1,069 units permitted, consistent with past biennial cyclical behavior. Santa Barbara County’s housing market continued its growth in terms of home values, albeit at a slower rate. From January 2019 to January 2020, the Zillow Home Value Index, an estimate of the median home value, for Santa Barbara County increased from $642,288 to $651,801, a 1.47% change. This is down by over half of last year’s growth in home values of 3.98% increase. The median home price in Santa Barbara County throughout 2019 ($643,119) remains below its pre-recession high of $692,400 in January of 2006. Conversely, median prices in the overall US and California housing market have both remained above their pre-recession peaks. All 3 geographies experienced declines in Year over Year (YoY) growth rates of home values starting in January 2014. These declines continued throughout 2019. In fact, 2019 saw a large dip in home value growth beginning in March, reaching a minimum between July and September depending on the region under consideration. Throughout this period, year over year growth of Santa Barbara County home values reached a minimum of 0.42%. Neighboring San Louis Obispo County, however, fared much worse, reaching a minimum of -0.30%. Since then, home value growth has rebounded back to its secular trend. Of particular interest is that, while the United States as a whole also experienced a dip of sorts, the decline and subsequent rebound in year over year growth is most dramatic for the entirety of the State of California. Given the size of California, and the relative value of its housing market compared to the rest of the United States, the decline in year over year growth for the country may be driven in large part by California alone. Inventories, calculated as the estimated number of median homes for sale in a given region, decreased across all three geographies (Santa Barbara County, California, and the US) following last year’s rebound. Santa Barbara experienced a decline in inventories from a peak of 939 in January 2019 to 614 in March 2020. California saw an even larger decrease in levels, from a peak of 78,265 in December 2018 to 58,293 in March 2020, though the decline in Santa Barbara County was larger in relative terms. This dip in inventories across the United States, while still present, is much smaller than that in both California and Santa Barbara County housing markets and appears to be a return to the Country’s secular trend in inventories beginning in 2013. Take note of the fact that declining inventories could be due to one or more of many different supply and demand forces, and how efficiently real estate markets match buyers with sellers. The health of local housing markets depends crucially on the source of the change in inventories and not simply the stock of inventories itself. Affordability The Housing Affordability Index from the California Association of Realtors gives the percentage of households in California counties that can afford to purchase the median-priced house in their respective areas. On a national level, 57% of United States residents could afford the median-priced house in the country during 2019Q4, an increase of 3 percentage points relative to last year. California’s Housing Affordability Index is much lower than the national average, with 31% of California residents being able to afford the median-priced house in the state. Santa Barbara County falls further below this number at 23%. This is a significant decline from last year’s 32% and places it below the California average. Moreover, Santa Barbara County is now ranked the 6th least affordable county of the 49 counties for which data is available. Housing Prices and Sales Home Price data from the California Association of Realtors shows that real median home price for Santa Barbara County increased by 6% over the last year, roughly double the 3.4% growth in prices for California and triple the 2.0% growth rate for Los Angeles County. When looking separately at North County and the South Coast, the median home price in the South Coast rose by 2.6% whereas the median home price in North County fell by 1.8%. The discrepancy between the aggregate and disaggregated numbers is likely due to the fact that North County prices are driving down the level of median prices for the county and the increase in prices in the South Coast is driving the change in prices for the County as a whole. Sales Price vs. List Price When comparing list prices and sales prices, the median home sales price is close to the median list price in Santa Barbara County, though all areas in Santa Barbara City and Goleta show that bargaining between property owners and buyers results in a price reduction. This may be indicative of a higher bargaining power on the part of buyers. In fact, no geography consider boasts a sale price higher than the listing price. This contrasts with 2018, when Hope Ranch, for example, maintained a sale to list price ratio of 110%. Throughout the County, the lowest sales price as a percent of the list price was 80% in Hope Ranch. List prices vary significantly between cities, with Hope Ranch being the most expensive and Lompoc being the least expensive. Median list prices for these two geographies are $3,699,500 and $399,000, respectively. SB South Coast: Single Family Home Listings, Sales and Prices Hope Ranch mean and median sale prices declined substantially in 2019, from $4,989,922 to $4,569,611 and $3,722,500 to $2,974,000, respectively. This represents the largest level change in the Santa Barbara South Coast region and brings Hope Ranch’s median home price back in line with historic prices after stark rise in 2018. Santa Barbara East of State Street and Goleta North of Highway 101 saw very modest changes in median and mean home prices. The largest increase in mean home prices during 2019 is in the Carpinteria/Summerland region, with average prices rising from $1,496,391 to $2,936,219. Given that the median price saw a very small decline, it is likely the case that a small number of high value sales is skewing the average for the Carpinteria/Summerland area. Santa Barbara and Goleta: Condominium Listings, Sales and Prices The Santa Barbara and Goleta condominium price data from the Santa Barbara Association of Realtors Multiple Listing Services shows that all areas with the exception of Goleta-South of Highway 101 experienced an increase in both the mean and median price of condos. Moreover, both the number of listings and number of condo sales rose in Santa Barbara-East of State Street and Goleta-North of Highway 101. Santa Barbara-West of State Street and Goleta-South of Highway 101 saw a decline in both condo listings and sales. Housing Permits In Santa Barbara County, total residential unit permits rebounded from last years decline to 1,069. The data herein presented suggests that this type of cyclical behavior is a central characteristic of the Santa Barbara County real estate market, at least over the past 6 years. Both single family unit permits and multi-family unit permits increased, from 479 to 609 and 367 to 460, respectively. Moreover, the share of multi-family permits declined from 57% to 43%. Carpinteria and Guadalupe both experienced a decline in multifamily unit permits and an increase in single family unit permits. Santa Maria on the other hand had a large decline in single family unity permits and a more than tripling of multifamily unit permits. Santa Barbara County South Coast Apartment Rental Market Guest Author: Dawn Dyer Dyer-Sheehan Group In preparation. — 6.2 Commercial Hayes Commercial Group South Coast Commercial Real Estate – 2020 Midyear Market Report Guest Authors: Greg Bartholomew, Christos Celmayster, Francois DeJohn, Steve Hayes, Dan Moll, Liam Murphy, and Kristopher Roth Adapting to the coronavirus economy and the “new abnormal” Against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, South Coast commercial real estate—like the economy in general—is in low gear. Transaction volume is down significantly compared to previous years, providing limited data to re-establish pricing for the market. In addition, the variability in the economy—with cycles of opening and closing—creates a rollercoaster effect that keeps property values in flux. Here are the highlights: Transaction value decreased 68% for sales and 44% for lease consideration, compared to the prior 5-year averages. Transactions hit a trough in April and May, but recovered momentum in June and into July. Since the beginning of the year, for sale inventory expanded 19% while total available space for lease stayed level. Prices and rents have not decreased significantly, so far. Demand is soft and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. However, deals are happening and there is opportunity in the current market. It will be interesting to see how the resurgence of coronavirus infections in July will affect both the economics and psychology of commercial real estate transactions. The impact of drawing down the economy again will be substantial, but the shock mentality that prevailed in the spring months will be less of a factor, as consumers and businesses have more experience with pandemic conditions. On the other hand, if PPP loans dry up, children aren’t able to consistently attend school, and people continue to stay home, this fall could bring a rash of business closings, increased unemployment, and a widening gap between supply and demand in the commercial real estate sector. On the bright side, the activity we are seeing—new requirements, showings, and deals in negotiation—is cause for optimism and a reminder that the pandemic will not go on forever. In addition, as with any major inflection point in the economy, there will be opportunities in the market, particularly for owner-users and tenants. COMMERCIAL SALES Following a record year in 2019, South Coast commercial sales dollar volume was very low through midyear. This is not surprising, given the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the local economy. However, dollar volume in January and February—before the pandemic took hold—was down 66% year-over-year compared to 2019. Activity remained sporadic in the subsequent months, yielding the lowest midyear totals for both transactions and dollar value since 2009. On the positive side, after hitting a low of just one transaction in May, sales activity gathered momentum in June that has continued into July. Most notably, the oceanfront office campus that serves as Procore’s headquarters with an asking price of $48 million was purchased by an investor at the beginning of July, by far the largest sale of the year to date. Our brokers report that there is noticeably more happening compared to April and May when the market seemed to be in shock. This 24,772 SF office building at 1145 Eugenia Pl in Carpinteria was one of the few notable investment sales, trading for $9 million. The low deal volume provides scant data to indicate the extent to which the pandemic is affecting property values. The handful of investment sales suggests cap rates have not moved meaningfully. We know anecdotally that buyers have been seeking a “COVID-19 discount,” and some sellers are conceding. However, such discounts have been relatively modest, and if there are buyers trying to exploit the crisis to get a great deal, they haven’t succeeded so far. The prices of off-market transactions are also in line with recent historical values. Off-market deals represented 58% of transactions to date, whereas the typical ratio is well below half. This may be a statistical aberration due to limited data, but off-market transactions typically correlate with strong demand. The most notable off-market sale was 5551 Ekwill St in Goleta, an 11,200 SF industrial/office building purchased by an owner-user for $3.7 million in June. Owner-users have not played as prominent a role in the market as in recent years. Through midyear, 42% of sales were purchased by owner-users, a typical ratio historically but a decrease from the past two years, during which more than half of sales were owner-user purchases. In 2018-2019 investor demand contracted somewhat, while owner-user demand surged. So far this year, both buyer types have retreated, while returning to their typical ratios with about 60% of transactions to investors and 40% to owner-users. The standout investment sale of the first two quarters was 1145 Eugenia Pl, a 24,772 SF office building in Carpinteria that sold for $9 million in March. A mixed-use building in Summerland, 2560 Lillie Ave, was the highest-value owner-user sale to date, trading for $4.2 million in February. In times of economic stress, uncertainty clouds property values, and buyers and sellers both take a cautious approach to pricing. There are 75 properties for sale, which is a historic high for the South Coast and represents a 19% expansion since the beginning of the year. There is ample property for sale, and there are a decent number of buyers in the market. The main factor inhibiting deals is price. Investors are building significant risk into their offers, since there are so many economic unknowns, and seem content to wait for sellers to blink. Sellers appear willing to accept a small discount to make a deal, but most would prefer to ride out the storm rather than accept a major price cut. In this environment, owner-users may find opportunities to purchase vacant property at relatively low prices. Barring a major breakthrough in the public health crisis, such as a vaccine, we expect the gap between investors and owners on pricing to constrict transaction volume for the remainder of 2020. LEASING In general, the leasing markets progressed through a profound dip in transaction activity from March through May, producing some of the lowest monthly volumes on record. Transactions and consideration were less than half of the prior 5-year monthly average (as seen in the graph). In June, leasing activity rebounded to the more typical level seen in the first two months of the year, as more businesses started opening back up. Midyear gross absorption for all property types was about 40% below the prior 5-year average. As a new surge of coronavirus cases flares up in July, there will likely be some slow leasing months again in the third quarter, and fits and starts in the market may be expected throughout the course of the pandemic. OFFICE Office leasing volume is down on the South Coast, but the combined vacancy rate since year-end has been flat. By and large, tenants have continued paying rent while many if not most of their employees work from home. Uncertainty about what comes next makes forecasting demand for office property especially tricky. What percentage of workers will shift to working from home long-term? For those who return to the office full-time, what will the employee density expectation be? The time horizon is also uncertain. If a reliable vaccine or instant testing emerges to give workers confidence working in close proximity, the office environment could rapidly return to pre-COVID configurations. However, if contagion remains a persisting concern over a longer term, office tenants will be faced with a combination of workspace partitioning, distancing, and other measures affecting how space is used. The answers to these questions could have enormous impact on the office market. Santa Barbara Santa Barbara’s office market has been in a cycle of elevated inventory for the past few years, with vacancy around 6%. Despite relatively low leasing volume, the first half of the year brought only a slight expansion to a 6.1% vacancy rate, the highest rate on record. About half of the available space has been on the market for more than a year, reflecting some stagnancy in the inventory. There are five spaces larger than 10,000 square feet available downtown. The largest, 26,000 SF at 402 E Gutierrez St, is creative space geared for tech. The other four are professional offices in named buildings—the Semler, Lyon, Freitas, and Grayson buildings—totaling 62,000 SF. Professional office, with a higher proportion of individual offices to facilitate distancing, could attract relatively high demand over the next few years, compared to the open, collaborative areas long favored by creative office tenants. Still, given current demand, these large vacancies will take some time to absorb. Leasing activity as measured by gross absorption was 28% below the prior 5-year average. Also telling, 42% of the transactions were renewals, compared to 20% in 2019, indicating the drop in demand among tenants looking for a new space. Both asking and achieved lease rates have held steady, so far, and in fact achieved rates are actually up about 8% compared to 2019, thanks to a handful of high-rent leases on Coast Village Road and near Cottage Hospital. If competition for tenants heats up, asking rents in Santa Barbara—which are 40% higher than in Goleta—will come under increasing pressure. Notable transactions in the second quarter were American Riviera Bank’s renewal of 12,939 SF at 1033 Anacapa St, Mercer Advisors’ renewal of 10,935 SF at 1801 E Cabrillo Blvd, and a new lease of 4,993 SF at 2400 Bath St by Santa Barbara Cardiovascular Group. Two leases totaling 31,500 SF were signed at 125 Cremona Dr in Goleta, a building recently vacated by Medtronic. Goleta Following relatively typical deal volume in the first quarter, Goleta saw a sharp decrease in activity, producing only three transactions totaling 17,000 SF in the subsequent three months. As of midyear, gross absorption was trending 50% below the prior 5-year average. Notable deals included 23,458 SF at 125 Cremona Dr, the former Medtronic building, leased by Digital Surgery Systems. Nearby, Toyon Research leased 23,400 SF at 25 Castilian Dr on a long-term basis. After hitting the lowest vacancy rate on record of 4.6% in the first quarter, Goleta’s vacancy rate remains relatively low at 5.0%, and so far there hasn’t been a substantial increase in new spaces coming to market. The largest availability on the market is the balance of the former Medtronic building, 32,900 SF at 125 Cremona Dr. The lull in transactions is cause for concern, but it bears reminding that Goleta currently has half the available space that it had just 24 months ago. Carpinteria Leasing activity was minimal in Carpinteria during the last two quarters. There were five lease transactions as of midyear, all of which were smaller leases. Gross absorption to date is trending 60% below the prior 5-year average on an annualized basis. Despite low volume, the vacancy rate in Carpinteria has remained stable and below 5% for the past two years. RETAIL The pandemic has accelerated the shift in consumer spending to e-commerce. Brick-and-mortar retail, which was already struggling to attract and retain shoppers, has been decimated, with national retailers—including department stores, clothing and other soft goods, fitness, even drug stores—announcing bankruptcies or massive store closings almost daily. On the South Coast, the list of retailers and restaurants closing during the pandemic continues to grow: national tenants like Nordstrom, Forever 21, Subway, Sur La Table, and Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, along with locals like Plum Goods, Zizzo’s Coffee, and Chuck’s Waterfront Grill. The news isn’t all bleak. There have been some openings as well, such as Ca’ Dario and Mesa Burger on Coast Village Road, Corner Tap at 1905 Cliff Dr and Lighthouse Coffee at 711 Chapala St. And there was a major lease by a national retailer, the 21,577 SF anchor space at 7127 Hollister Ave in Goleta claimed by LA Fitness in June. LA Fitness leased 21,577 SF at 7127 Hollister Ave in Goleta in June. The second quarter brought just a handful of leases in Santa Barbara, including Aqua-Flo’s signing of 7,386 SF at 18 S Milpas St, Alpha Resource Center’s lease of 3,661 SF at 1911 De La Vina St, and the former Wildwood Kitchen space at 410 E Haley St was leased by Feast Kitchen. Along the downtown retail corridor, the novelty of outdoor dining and blocks of State Street closed to vehicles have created a lively scene for locals looking to go out, while providing an impromptu test run for the promenade concept that many have been advocating in recent years. This action by the City has helped give restaurants a chance to stay in business during the pandemic, which is much needed because the downtown corridor is struggling. Since the beginning of the year, the 400 to 1300 blocks have seen 15 spaces become vacant or come to market, eight of which were occupied by food and beverage tenants. The storefront vacancy rate has grown from 10% at the beginning of the year to 15% currently. Additional vacancies are likely to arise in the second half of the year, as more businesses are expected to close permanently. Local consumers, the City, and landlords are all playing a part to help local businesses, and we applaud the ingenuity and perseverance of so many proprietors and their employees in very challenging times. The pandemic will eventually pass, but its impact on stores, restaurants, gyms and bars will reverberate for many years to come. INDUSTRIAL Nationally, industrial markets have been more stable than other commercial property types during the pandemic, largely because warehouses are essential to corporate e-commerce. Although Amazon has reportedly sniffed around for warehouse space on the South Coast in recent years, there aren’t any distribution centers here. However, our market’s limited supply of industrial space protects against excess vacancy during an economic downturn. Available space has expanded slightly since the beginning of the year, but the vacancy rate is still below 3% for the South Coast. Santa Barbara’s vacancy rate remains very low—below 1%—and average achieved lease rates to date were above $2.00 per SF gross, a very high average, historically. The largest space leased to date was 14,368 SF at 415 N Salsipuedes St leased by Kamran &amp; Co in the first quarter. Santa Barbara saw a surprising seven transactions in the second quarter, including the lease by Andros Floor Design of three new buildings totaling 9,292 SF at 35 N Calle Cesar Chavez. Goleta’s vacancy rate is relatively high at 5.4%, largely due to the 102,000 SF space vacated by Powell Skate One at 30 S La Patera Ln. April and May were very active for Goleta industrial leasing, producing six transactions totaling 53,000 SF. Among those, Farm and Ranch Management Services leased 20,794 SF at 5756 Thornwood Dr, and Cox Communications secured 17,703 SF at 149 Castilian Dr, the two largest spaces leased year to date. Farm and Ranch Management leased 20,794 SF at 5756 Thornwood Dr in Goleta in April, the South Coast’s largest industrial lease to date. In Carpinteria, there were only two transactions as of midyear, both in the second quarter, including 5,224 SF at 1115 Mark Ave leased by Inevifit. Despite the scarcity of deals, the vacancy rate held level and relatively low at 1.9%. However, more than 50,000 SF of industrial space is scheduled to hit the market in the third quarter, which is projected to increase the vacancy rate to approximately 5%. Multifamily Sales With half of 2020 behind us and uncertain times ahead, given the global health crisis, the local multifamily market stands to fare as one the strongest sectors of the real estate investment markets. Throughout the South Coast, the feedback from owners and property managers of apartments is that rent collections have remained virtually unaffected by the pandemic, unlike sectors such as retail and office. At worst, collections were no less than 95% of a landlord’s gross scheduled rents. As we navigate the months ahead with increasing unemployment and unknowns regarding government aid, it’s an open question whether this high collection rate will continue. The apartment sales market started the year slowly, recording only four sales in the first quarter. And the second quarter, during the newly-implemented “shelter in place” orders, produced only two sales. Although the pandemic certainly stalled activity while sellers and buyers settled into the new “normal,” the lack of activity was driven largely driven by a shortage of supply. As is normally the case for South Santa Barbara County, a limited inventory of apartment product prevailed for most of the first half of 2020. Toward the end of the second quarter, several new listings were introduced to the market as sellers realized that buyer demand remained for apartments and that prices were holding, despite the pandemic. The arrival of new inventory has continued into the third quarter, and several of these newer offerings have gone into escrow. Expect more product to hit the market in the second half of 2020, which will be met with buyer interest as long as the property is well located and offers a market return. Which leads to the million-dollar question: what is a market return in a COVID world? Looking at the six sales to date and the inventory that has come to the market recently, the market cap rate appears to be 4%, or greater, on properties where rents are already close to market. For valued-add opportunities, where the property requires some repositioning and increases to existing rents, limited by AB 1482 of course, buyers are looking to see a trajectory to a 5% cap rate, or greater, on realistic market rents. Interest rates remain at historic lows, buttressing the justification for lower returns on apartment investments. However, certain major lenders are more cautious about lending, given their exposure in other real estate sectors that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. As such, expect some lenders to offer attractive rates but require higher debt coverage ratios, lower loan to value ratios, and other limitations that may make obtaining leverage more difficult. There are several lenders still offering great lending terms, so it will behoove buyers to shop their loans before committing to a lender. Despite this, as long as interest rates remain low and rent collections remain strong, the attractiveness of the lower—but more stable—cap rates offered by apartment investments will keep prices trending in a seller’s favor. Radius Insight: 2020Q1 South Coast Market Report Guest Authors: The Radius Team Raduys Commercial Real Estate Investment COVID-19 and Commercial Real Estate A lot can change in three months. While we started the year discussing how long the bull market may continue, we ended the first quarter of 2020 questioning when and if it may again be safe to shake on a deal. Literally. This is a trying time on all fronts. Every person around the world is impacted by the spread of the novel coronavirus, and though it may feel a little shallow to consider the effects of COVID-19 on the commercial real estate industry, our job as professionals is to ensure our clients are fully prepared to move forward with recovery. We will get through this. Our generation (let’s face it, EVERYONE is in this together) has certainly seen tragedy and hard times. The events of 9-11 and the Great Recession come to mind. This is different. For most of us it feels like the world has ground to a complete halt, with the exception of our essential workers and frontline healthcare heroes who thankfully are trudging along because they must. But if you look closely, beyond our empty streets and 2-D television screens, you’ll see the heart of our economy still beats. In fact there are workers out there every day doing what they can to keep the economy moving. Restaurants working behind closed doors have evolved into small grocery co-ops and delivery services. Companies are actively seeking out warehouse and industrial space to store goods that are being ordered online and shipped direct to consumer. Others are transitioning their manufacturing to meet immediate needs big and small, everything from creating test kits to sewing masks. Yes, this is our economy for now. That will change in time. We have talked with many of you over the past few weeks and will continue to reach out. One common question we’re hearing right now, from landlords and tenants, buyers and sellers, is “What should I do?” Because we are in unchartered territory, there are many underlying considerations and certainly a wealth of sometimes contradictory opinions. But where we are trying to focus the conversation is around communication. The fact is we are living in a fluid situation, and now more than ever we need to talk. Perhaps nowhere is that more important than between landlords and tenants. We would advise clients to be honest and open in these conversations, and to seek flexibility wherever possible. For example, while there are restrictions in place for certain types of evictions, those will not always be there and landlords will look to be made whole. If you are a tenant who has been truly impacted by current events, be prepared to open your books to your landlord. For the owners, we would advise trying to be creative, where possible, with agreements that give some respite now but with the understanding that it is recouped in the long term, either through an extended lease or through a payment plan, for example. On the sales side we believe there could be opportunities for buyers coming up depending on their sources of income. Lending is still happening, but be prepared for hiccups that may come along depending on a lender’s level of comfort with this new economy. Sellers need to consider whether now is truly the best time to go to market, and if they do they should be prepared for deals to take longer. And on our end, know that your commercial real estate professional will be there to guide you through the process. Almost daily we receive new information on changing regulations, guidelines and best practices in transacting commercial real estate. There has never been a more challenging time to consider going it alone, so we strongly encourage you to pick up the phone. The Radius Team will work with you to find answers, solutions and success. Commercial Sales Summary: What a Difference a Quarter Makes The recent “Corona Crisis” has sent everyone into lockdown, thrown all financial markets into a tailspin and brought commercial real estate activity to a crawl. Since none of us have lived through a crisis that included both a pandemic and stock market meltdown, it is difficult if not impossible to predict the direction of the market. We do think it is safe to say that most investors will be cautious observers for the immediate future, watching to see how and when we recover from these setbacks. Financing and available credit will also be key to restoring some stability in the market for both investors and owner-users. It seems like just yesterday when we reported year-end statistics and status for 2019, noting a market that was humming along with some pretty stable numbers for sales and increasing totals in dollar volume. While the number of deals during the first quarter of 2020 are somewhat normal, boy how times have changed. From January through March we did see 15 commercial sales on the South Coast, matching the first quarter totals in both 2019 and 2018. What has changed dramatically is dollar volume. This year we slipped down to just $39.2MM, or roughly 38% of Q1 2019 ($104MM), and about 19% of Q4 2019 ($210.6MM). Difficult to say if any trend is to be deduced given current circumstances, but again all eyes will be on the coming several quarters. The largest sale during the first quarter was an office building at 1145 Eugenia Pl. in Carpinteria. This 27,772sf building traded for $9MM, which represents a 6% cap if the building was fully leased (9,000sf is vacant). Other notable sales included a 7,000sf office building with two apartment units at 115 E. Micheltorena St.—previously home to the accounting firm MacFarlane Faletti &amp; Co.—which sold for $5.6MM to an owner-occupant; and the two-story, 13,241sf retail building at 524 State Street—the former Scientology building—which sold for $5.7MM. The buyer in that one was a group of investors with plans to transform the property into a boutique hotel. By the numbers, during the quarter there were eight (8) office sales, two (2) industrial sales, one (1) land sale, and four (4) retail sales. Once again, owner-users outnumbered investors 10-to-5. Needless to say, most of these transactions were in advanced stages of escrow before the Corona Crisis. For now, we are all paying special attention to the progress of the pandemic for our own health and well-being. As business people, we are also closely watching the effects of the federal government’s interventions to see if that will help soften the blow and get everyone back on their economic feet in the near future. As history has shown, the South Coast has tended to fair better than other markets during slowdowns. Only time will tell. Multifamily Sales Summary Santa Barbara County The year started with multifamily sales activity in the local market continuing as previous quarters, but the first quarter of 2020 ended on uncertain footing along with all financial markets as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. While the stock market and and the commercial real estate industry are getting hit substantially as the financial impacts of the virus are difficult to quantify, multifamily real estate still remains the safest of investment real estate property types due to the constant need for housing, no matter the circumstances. With other commercial sectors like retail obviously getting hit harder and with instability in equity markets, multifamily may strengthen as investors seek stability. Furthermore, our local Santa Barbara communities, a long-time safe haven for investors, has shown resistance to the pandemic due to its geography, roughly 100 miles from the nearest metropolitan area, and lower density than other areas in California. Before the pandemic gathered steam, very little inventory had traded in our region. As usual, a high number of investors continued to be in the hunt for opportunties, but most properties ended up trading off market. With this low inventory, there were really only three highlight sales in the County, one in Isla Vista, one in Santa Barbara and one in Santa Maria. Again, none of these assets were broadly marketed. The largest of these was the sale of the Breakpointe and Coronado complexes, two student housing assets in Isla Vista totaling 149 units. The deal closed at $73,700,000 or roughly $495,000/unit, despite trading just three years ago for roughly 70% of that price. The new owner was able to capitalize on a minor rehabilitation of the assets, low interest rates and pent-up investor demand for student housing, quietly marketing the offering and ultimately selling on a by-the-bed basis. Selling student housing assets by the bed has helped owners increase their sale price per unit by maximizing revenue for skilled operators who can utilize this leasing strategy. Interestingly enough the asset sold just before the closure of the UCSB campus. Even though the school remains shut down, rent collections are still hovering around 80 – 90 percent and pre-leasing is still occurring. The major question remains whether UCSB will open on schedule for the fall quarter. If it doesn’t, rent collections may drop next year and landlords could have a harder time enforcing leases. The other two highlight sales were in the city of Santa Barbara and Santa Maria, both being sizeable off-market transactions. An 18-unit building at 401 W. Los Olivos St., Santa Barbara near Cottage Hospital and consisting of all studio units closed for $4.7 million. Both the buyer and seller had new hurdles to climb with fresh state and local rent legislation—including the AB1482 rent cap bill and the City of Santa Barbara’s mandatory 1 year lease offer ordinance—creating additional paperwork. With a building such as this with below market rents, the buyers were still able to achieve attractive financing by showing upside over a longer period of time, even though the new rent cap of 5% + CPI staggers those returns over a longer period. Still, month-to-month tenancy helps as there is a naturally higher rate of turnover, allowing the new owner to more quickly achieve market rents. Meanwhile in the North County, a property at 317 – 323 N. Western Ave. sold for $5.5 million. This was a heavy value-add deal selling to a Los Angeles based investor with a concentration of assets in Santa Maria. The price per unit was $137,500, below average for Santa Maria. The next largest deal occurring in Santa Maria was at 826 W. Cook St., a 16-unit asset in a great location close to all the preferred amenities in the city. That building sold for $2.5 million or $156,200-per-door at an approximate 5.6% cap rate. Ventura Ventura experienced very low transaction volume during the first quarter with just two smaller assets selling. One was an 8-unit building at 6329 Whipporwill St. in Ventura. The other was located at 1829 E. Ocean Ave. which consisted of cottage-style units. There was also one 12-unit asset in Oxnard which came to market and quickly went into escrow. Still, the Ventura markets continue to be in high demand by investors, from Camarillo through Ventura and into Ojai. There are a few sizeable off-market deals in escrow and one or two assets possibly coming online in the coming months. San Luis Obispo San Luis Obispo did not record any sizeable transactions in Q1, similar to Ventura. There is one 13-unit student housing asset adjacent to the Cal Poly campus at 1238 E. Foothill Rd. that has seen multiple escrows and is back in escrow again, possibly closing in the next two months. According to several student housing owners, pre-leasing for the fall was slightly stronger this year than last and collections have been at approximately 80 – 90 percent despite COVID-19. Lending Update Clearly COVID- 19 has caused much disturbance to the real estate markets as tenants have borne the direct impact. The ability to earn revenue and pay rent ultimately will find its way to landlords. While this is a massive problem in retail and office real estate, tenants are receiving help paying their rent from the unprecedented government stimulus package and broadened unemployment compensation. Lenders are mostly pulling back on lending to other property types but many local and national banks are still bullish on multifamily, as they should be, since we can see that the fundamentals are still strong. Nevertheless, risk is still increasingly prevalent as, over the short term, unemployment will hamper asking and achieved rents from apartment tenants. To compensate for this additional risk, many lenders are increasing their debt service coverage ratios and although the federal funds rate is 0%, interest rates are flat to possibly increasing slightly, and appraisals are coming in more conservative as well. Still, there is money out there for multifamily and relationship lending is the name of the game. Local banks want to keep their relationship clients happy and are doing their best to extend credit to strong clients at numbers that aren’t too far off from before the pandemic. South Coast Leasing Summary Over the past 20 years, Radius has been publishing these quarterly market reports providing analysis of the previous quarter while looking forward to the future. During this stretch it is arguable we have never entered a quarter with more uncertainty than the current one. While it’s abundantly clear we are all in this together for better or worse, our three main leasing sectors—industrial, office and retail—are not equal in the impact the pandemic has thrust upon us. The industrial sector in the South Coast market will perhaps weather the COVID-19 situation better than the office and retail space, as warehousing and distribution have remained relatively operational. In fact the technology sector which accounts for a substantial portion of industrial and R&amp;D square footage in our market, may prove to be the most insulated and best prepared to adapt to the turbulence created by this crisis. The only real notable change in South Coast leasing during the quarter was the Goleta industrial vacancy rate jumping by five basis points, from 5.2 percent in Q4 2019 to 9.3 percent by the end of Q1 2020. That increase was largely due to roughly 100,000 square feet of space coming available in February which was vacated by Skate One as they moved their warehouse down South. On the office front, the ability of our community to quickly transition to working from home has certainly been impressive. Video conferencing company Zoom, which has an office in downtown Santa Barbara and had previously been somewhat overshadowed by more well-known alternatives such as WebEx, GoToMeeting and even Microsoft Teams, has suddenly become a household name and is now arguably a leader in modern enterprise video communications as its virtual meeting and webinar platform has helped businesses and communities stay connected at a time when social distancing does not appropriately allow for in-person collaboration and communication. That said, while it remains difficult to ascertain if the government’s stay-at-home mandates will have lasting meaningful effect on the office leasing sector, it’s clear that many businesses who may have been in the market for new office space have largely hit the pause button on entering into new leases. Perhaps the biggest and most obvious question mark is the retail sector. Our local retailers have had to endure many challenges over the past several years in the form of the fires and mudslides that devastated our communities as well as the increased popularity of online shopping, and current circumstances have dealt yet another gut-punch from which to find a way to recover. We have discussed at length the State Street conundrum in particular in past reports and recent events will likely put our struggling “main drag” under even more immense pressure and scrutiny. But the South Coast market’s traditional lack of new supply of office, industrial and retail space may turn out to be somewhat of a saving grace, allowing us to maneuver these uncertain times in better shape than other markets. During these unprecedented times communication between landlords and existing tenants will undoubtedly be paramount. Landlords will need to understand that tenants’ monthly payment obligations may need to be temporarily modified in order to keep the tenant’s business viable. At the same time tenants will need to understand that landlords have (at minimum) fixed building expenses such as mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc. that need to be met. The bottom line is all parties are taking it on the chin right now, so we all need to be in each other’s corner if we’re going to make it through these rounds. Today we are in unchartered territory, understatement of the year. But by the end of the second quarter we should start to see a clearer picture of the fallout of this crisis as well as the path forward. Santa Maria Real Estate Market – 2020 Noticeable Changes Guest Authors: Steve McCarty and Steve Davis Stafford-McCarty Commercial Real Estate Key Chapter Findings: Increased vacancy in all sectors Escalating construction costs The Cannabus Conundrum Continuing waning of transactions Residential Index Year over year data demonstrates residential home sale volumes have reached an equilibrium. For the last 5 years, Santa Maria residential sales have averaged a touch over 1,050 single family residential (SFR) units per year. Additionally, there has been little change in the median value of a single family home $407,750—-which equates to $245 per s.f. in 2018 to $248 per s.f. in 2019. Although the fact that the present market is holding at a consistent pace is good news for builders, it is noteworthy that the median value of a SFR in the Santa Maria market was $455,000 in 2006. It has been thirteen years and the housing market has not yet fully recovered from the recession. Interest rates have continued to remain low. Retail/Commercial There is less retail vacancy on the market this year as compared to last year. The current vacant retail inventory is approximately 6.25% (approximately 305,900 sq. ft. on a base of +/- 4,893,000 sq. ft.); improving from last year’s 10.01%. This being said, the most recent low was in 2016 years at 2.61%. When averaged over the last three year we have trended upward in vacancy. In regards to large spaces there is uncertainty concerning the re-tenanting of the former Costco, Fallas, Toy R’ Us , now Sears and possibly Penny’s. Spaces in the Town Center Mall have been vacant for years as evidenced the also by the former Wellenkamps retail building on Blosser Road. The approximately 105,000 sq. ft. Kmart building on 12.98 acres at 2875 Santa Maria Way sold for $6,500,000 or roughly $62 per sq. ft. including surplus land. This was purchased by U-Haul in a multiple property transaction. Stated plans are for self storage. The new homes for the local auto dealerships are well under construction at Enos Ranch and when complete, their former locations on Betteravia and Main will need to be backfilled. More car stores are reported. As noted in previous reports, there is still more development on the books: The Westgate Marketplace – approximately 130,000 sq. ft. Orcutt Plaza – approximately 225,000 sq. ft. Orcutt Marketplace – approximately 295,000 sq. ft. Generally, retail land values, are still holding and can range from $18.00 per sq. ft. to retail pad pricing at, approximately $35 per square foot. There is a redevelopment focus from the City of Santa Maria on its downtown core which proposes a higher density and a more pedestrian friendly environment. Surplus City owned parcels are being offered for development in the “old town” area—which were the origins of City of Santa Maria. . Office The weakest commercial segment continues to be office-which follows the general trend of the Central Coast. The market vacancy has increased from 12.53% for last year and has moved up to 15%. Approximately 210,667 sq. ft. of office space is presently vacant. The most significant inventory added is the new and highly visible 81,000 sq. ft. Coast Hills Credit Union headquarters at the gateway of Santa Maria at Betteravia and US101. Construction costs continue to escalate making tenant improvements expensive and this translates to higher rents. Typical buildouts can be $110-130 per sq. ft. over a shell interior. We are continuing to see a dichotomy in the office market. New or newer buildings yoked with higher construction costs, have pushed rents over $2.00 to $3.00 NNN per sq. ft. Owners of older inventory, depending upon its location, are left scrambling for whatever they can negotiate which can be $1.00 to $1.50 gross rent. The Office sales volume in Santa Maria has been low this year. 275 and 351 North Blosser Road sold to a neighboring property owner for $5,000,000. This as an office comparable sale is a bit confusing as it included shops and yard as well, but the major component was the office and the transaction size was notable for the market. 2400 Professional Parkway, 16,912 sq. ft. of office sold for $3,060,000, or approximately $181 per sq. ft. which is below the cost of reproduction for the property. Industrial Industrial product is starting to become available again in modest amounts and vacancy has increased again over last year moving from 3.3% to 4.23%. For 2019, the base inventory has had modest gains but remains at approximately 8,600,000 sq. ft. Given that Santa Maria has a significant agricultural base and support industries, buildings with enclosed yard space are, and have been, in regular demand. Rents are still holding strong even with increasing vacancy. For newer industrial space, owners are asking $0.75 to $0.85 sq. ft./mo. NNN. Rental asking rates for flex space are from 1,500 sq. ft. units and larger are approximately $0.65 to $0.85 sq. ft. gross. Second or third generation space rents are typically $0.50 to $0.70 modified gross. Location can bear upon this as well. This year again, there was a modest number of transactions for 2019. An example: 2625 Skyway Drive, an approximately 18,973 sq. ft. well located concrete tilt-up building sold to a buyer for their own operations for $3,000,000–which works out to +/- $158 sq. ft. This value is still estimated to be below the cost of reproduction. As a counter point to waning inproved property transactions, industrial land sales have been active after years of little activity and prices are trending upward. Several industrial land sales noted for 2019 (from larger to smaller land size transactions): Approximately 19 acres of unimproved PD/CM land sold to a box company for its expansion in the market for $4,454,000 or approximately $5.30 per sq. ft. A mid-range parcel transaction of 7 acres sold on Betteravia for $3,165,000 or approximately $11.85 and on the smaller end of the scale a 1.31 acre finished parcel on Skyway Drive sold for $565,000 or $9.90 per sq. ft. The largest single area of industrial fee land is known as Area 9. This was to supply the City of Santa Maria with many options to grow its industrial base and provide for head of household jobs. Windset Farms located here and has expanded with its state of the art greenhouse operations so much so that the City is now essentially out of ground for industrial land. The remaining commercial ground in the Area 9 plan lacks infrastructure and is also in competition with the expanding need for residential uses. Agricultural Valuations and lease rates are holding without significant transactions in this market. Berry and ground suitable for row crops are still in the $55,000 to $65,000 an acre range. Planted vineyards have been valued at approximately $60,000 per acre and plantable ground can be $36,000 and higher. The ag sector novation has been the cannabis industry surfacing to light. The cannabis market has created a conundrum and points to a bubble. In Lompoc reported buildings are in escrow for $100 per sq. ft. higher than typical transactions, only to “flip” prior to close for an additional $100 per sq. ft. Regulation, taxation, supply, over supply….small ranches have leased for $8,000 an acre per month. This works out to $19,200 per year compared top shelf berry ground for $3,000 an acre. These dynamic and extreme rates increases point lead to questions regarding sustainability and a potential bubble burst. Commercial Investment There were just a few investment sales in the Santa Maria market in 2019. Following are some noted investment transactions by market type demonstrating the range in capitalization rates: Office: Professional Parkway 16,912 sq. ft. $3,060,000 or $181 per sq. ft. 6.4 cap get data 2815 Airpark 36, 300 sq. ft. $10.552,500 or $291 per sq. ft. 6.0 cap Apartments: St Claire Apartments - 1735 Biscayne 128 units in off market sale Sale Price: $40,000,000. Roughly 160,896 sq. ft. of living space or $249/sq. ft. or $312,500/unit 4.9 cap rate Land zoned for apartments –typically R-3–is selling for approximately $16.00 sq. ft., however smaller approved projects have had escrows in the $20’s per sq. ft. Summary Land use and need for expansion are hot topics with the North County communities with the County of Santa Barbara holding the keys to growth for these cities. The City of Santa Maria started the multi-year process of annexation for their economic vision. California is mandating the north county cities provide space for expanded residential units and the discussion for the communities is do we go “up” with higher density within the urban core or “out” by annexing surrounding lands. There continues to be a fair amount of land zoned for office available in the City of Santa Maria and office vacancy is climbing. Industrial vacancy has climbed a bit, but there continues to be strong demand, especially for larger buildings with yard area. As the City reviews their land use designations, it will be interesting to see if they perceive enough demand for industrial and housing needs to alter the current land uses. Notes: For the purpose of this report, databank numbers include functional, selected non-competitive inventory (older buildings and warehouses) and excludes non-market square footage such as mini-storage, airport hangers, etc. A Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate) is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income (NOI—which does not include debt service) by the purchase price, e.g. $100,000 NOI/ $1,500,000 purchase price equals .0667 or a 6.67 cap rate.

["comm.html", "Chapter 7 Community 7.1 Demographics 7.2 Crime 7.3 Education 7.4 Environment", " Chapter 7 Community 7.1 Demographics Key Points: Deviating from the long-term trend of increasing populations in the tri-counties, 2019 faced the first year of decreasing population in the recorded data. Net migration was negative in 2019 after 8 years of positive net migration. Santa Barbara’s white population is declining, while people of other ethnicities are increasing. 7.1.1 Local Demographics The tri-counties area is composed of Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, and San Luis Obispo Counties. In 2019, population growth dipped into the negative with a –0.15% growth. The tri-counties experienced its highest growth rate in 2013 and 2014 of about 0.9% in both years, according to the recorded data. Each of the three counties recorded negative population growth, which contributed to the tri-county data. Santa Barbara experienced a –0.16% growth rate, Ventura county experienced –0.19% growth rates, and San Luis Obispo experienced a –0.02% growth rate. In Santa Barbara County specifically, the unincorporated areas of Santa Barbara experienced the highest growth rates in 2019 at 1.59%. On the other hand, many areas of Santa Barbara experienced negative growth. This includes Santa Maria, Santa Barbara City, and Lompoc. Among cities with a negative growth rate, Santa Maria faced the lowest growth rate, at –1.68%. This is a staggering difference compared to 2018, when Santa Maria had a positive growth rate of 0.46%. 7.1.2 Components of Change According to data from the California Department of Finance, the population in Santa Barbara County as of July 2019, was higher than the population for July of 2018. The difference in population numbers most likely stems from differences in the collection methods used and the treatment of unincorporated areas, and differences in the areas incorporated into the overall Santa Barbara County population. However, the Department of Finance still shows that population growth is significantly lower than the average growth seen in past years. The recorded data by the Department of Finance dating back to the year 2000 indicates that average growth in the 19-year span is annually positive by 2,980 people. However, in 2019, the population only increased by 1,576. Furthermore, the increase in population was largely due to low deaths and high births in Santa Barbara County. Net migration in and out of Santa Barbara county was –408 people. This is the first time that net migration was negative since 2011 according to the data provided by the Department of Finance. 7.1.3 Demographic Detail Incorporated areas of Santa Barbara County are expected to see population decrease to 450,900 in 2020, down from the existing population of 453,000 in 2019. Among the decreasing population, there is no clear trend of groups of age demographics that are significantly increasing or decreasing. Similarly, gender groups do not indicate significant differences. However, change of population is seen more clearly in ethnicities in Santa Barbara County. The number of people categorized as white are seen to have a decreasing population, whereas Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Any Race have increasing populations. 7.1.4 Median Age The median age in the recorded areas of Santa Barbara County is expected to be 33.95 years old. Guadalupe has the lowest median age, at 28.4 years old, and Solvang has the highest age group at 43.9 years old. 7.1.5 Housing According to the Department of Finance, there are a total of 160,111 housing units in Santa Barbara County in 2019. This is a 0.94 percent increase from the household count of 158,622 last year in 2018. This contrasts with the recorded increase in population of only 0.25 percent from 2018. Furthermore, the vacancy rate increased from 6.20 to 6.60 in the past year. The housing density has remained very steady since 2014, and has only fluctuated between 2.9 and 2.91. Housing sizes vary across counties, but South Santa Barbara County has a higher percentage of low household population compared to North Santa Barbara County. Two-person households are the most common all across Santa Barbara County. Over 30 percent of South County’s households are two-person. 7.2 Crime Key Points: Violent crime rate slightly increased in Santa Barbara County between 2017 and 2018 but remains low relative to past crime rates since 1994. Carpinteria and Buellton violent crime decreased the most out of any other city, while Lompoc remains the leader in violent crime rates. Guadalupe has the lowest property crime rate, while Santa Barbara city had the highest in 2018. Over the past 10 years (2008-2018), both property and violent crime has declined. The only exceptions are a 60 percent increase of violent crime in Goleta, and a 14 percent increase in property crime in Lompoc. Comparing the most recent 2018 data for crime in Santa Barbara and the United States as a whole, there are 13.08 property crimes and 2.68 violent crimes for every 1,000 individuals in Santa Barbara County; in comparison, the U.S. has 22 property crimes and 3.69 violent crimes per 1,000 people. We will discuss the trends and break down the composition of crime in this section. 7.2.1 Property Crime As defined by The California Department of Justice, property crime is divided into three separate categories: burglary, motor vehicle theft, and larceny-theft. Larceny-theft makes up 68 percent of property crimes in 2018, totaling 5203 total crimes. The high percentage of larceny-theft is most likely attributed to the ease at which people can steal and resell small items through shoplifting, purse snatching, building and bicycle theft, etc. The second largest category of property crime was burglary, which constituted 17%, totaling 1322 in 2018. Motor vehicle thefts made up the smallest amount at 15%. Santa Barbara County property crime rates decreased for the second year in a row, falling by 23 percent from 2016 to 2018. All cities experienced this decrease. Solvang had the largest decrease at 40.71 percent less property crime than last year. Guadalupe has maintained the smallest property crime rate for the past three years, and Santa Barbara City has the highest property crime rates in the county, with 24.6 crimes for every 1,000 people in 2018. 7.2.2 Violent Crime Violent crime is separated into four sections: homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In 2018, Santa Barbara County’s violent crimes were mostly aggravated assaults, which made up 62% of violent crimes and totaled 931 counts, a modest decrease of 4 counts since 2017. The lowest percentage of violent crimes was homicides, which was 0.7% of total violent crimes and totaled 11 counts. In total, the number of violent crimes in Santa Barbara County decreased from 1,526 in 2017 to 1,493 in 2018. Violent crime rates increased in three cities, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Guadalupe. Violent crime declined most significantly in Buellton, where crime rates dropped by 51 percent. Lompoc continues to have the highest violent crime rate in the county. Relatively low rates in the rest of the County’s cities are offset by high rates in Unincorporated areas across the county, which do not report their crime data by area. 7.2.3 Crime Rates by City 7.3 Education Key Points: Charter school enrollment in Santa Barbara County has seen an increase in recent years. Enrollment at the University of California, Santa Barbara continues to rise, reaching a record high of 26,314 students for Fall Quarter in 2019. High School graduation rates increased for California, from 83.0% to 84.5%, and decreased slightly for Santa Barbara County, from 87.4% to 86.8%. In Santa Barbara County, public school enrollment dropped 0.5% between the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years, experiencing a slight decrease of 345 students. In fact, over the next 10 years, public K-12 enrollment is projected to shrink 2.1% compared to the 5.2% of growth experienced from the prior 10 years. So, where are the parents of Santa Barbara County taking their children? While most students attend public schools, there is evidence to suggest that a large portion of parents are choosing private schools, particularly religious ones. Private school enrollment declined very slightly by 21 students in 2018 but increased as a proportion of total enrollment reaching 7.13%. Charter schools, which are counted as public schools, have experienced significant increases in enrollment over the past 4 years. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, enrollment increased by 765 students, and in 2018 charter schools continued to add an additional 74 students. This trend has been the result of numerous new charter schools opening in Santa Barbara County and has been matched by a steady decrease in non-charter enrollment. In 2019, University of California, Santa Barbara Fall quarter enrollment broke a new record of 26,314 students, increasing 1.3% from last Fall quarter. Allan Hancock College registration increased from 13,410 to 13,856 in 2019. Santa Barbara City College enrolled 14,100 students this past Fall, dropping 6% from its 2018 enrollment, and continuing on a declining trend since 2013. 7.3.1 Expenditures on Education Using the following figures, we display the year-to-year changes in education expenditures at the state, county, and district level. These expenditures include the following costs: salaries, benefits, acquisitions, and construction. To measure these changes, we use the cost per average daily attendance (ADA), which measures the number of days of student attendance divided by the total number of days of instruction. At the state and county levels, expenditures per ADA continued the upward trend that began in 2013. For the 2018-19 school year, expenditures per ADA for the state and county rose by 8.6% and 9.1%, respectively. In contrast, the 2017-2018 school year saw this measure grow by 4.5% and 4.0% for state and county respectively. Specifically, for Santa Barbara County, spending per student varies widely across the school districts; although, nearly every district saw an increase during the 2018-2019 school year. Buellton Union Elementary, College Elementary, and Los Olivos Elementary were the only districts to experience declines. Montecito Union elementary once again holds highest cost per ADA. When looking at the growth trend of school spending, it is helpful to also consider indicators such as average class size, student teacher ratios, and other performance measures to better understand the trend. For example, the increase in the cost per ADA could be attributed to either an increase in expenditures or a fall in enrollment. The rise for this year may be due in part to the decline in enrollment if education spending has not sufficiently adjusted to the decrease. Alternatively, general increases in spending could account for increased costs, however these changes cannot be directly observed. Thus, we cannot determine which of these factors is the driving force. 7.3.2 Performance Indicators Created by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), the California Assessment of Student Performance Progress (CASSPP) replaced the STAR exam in the Spring of 2014 due to state efforts to change testing from multiple choice and memorization to more interactive questions that require critical analysis skills. Since the trial run in 2013-2014, the 2018-19 academic year will be the fifth year of publicly released results. Once again, the California state average exceeded Santa Barbara County’s average in both English and math. For grade 3 English, Santa Barbara had 43% of its students score in the Standard Met and Above categories in comparison to California’s 49%. In grade 5, California scored higher than Santa Barbara County with 52% of students in the top two categories, compared to Santa Barbara’s 47%. For grade 11, Santa Barbara County had 53% in the top two categories compared to California’s 57%. For grade 3 math, Santa Barbara County had 44% of their students score in the Standard Met and Above categories, while California had 50%. For grade 5, both California and Santa Barbara County topped last year’s performance, with 38% of California students and 32% of Santa Barbara students in the top two categories, compared to 36% and 29% last year. In grade 11, Santa Barbara County had 29% of its students achieve Standard Met and Above, the same as last year, and California had 32% of students achieve this level. In 2013, the California State Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science Standards which focuses on creating a shift in science education to have students express more conceptual and applied understanding of the material. As of 2019, the new California Science Test (CAST) was finalized and results are available for the first cohort of students taking the exam. Notably, students in grade 3 were not required to take the CAST exam and many students in grade 11 did not have scores listed. Similar to the English and Math tests, California as a whole performed higher than Santa Barbara County. The California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) was made to demonstrate a competency of English-language arts and mathematics and was required in order to earn a high school diploma. In October 2015, the CAHSEE was suspended for the 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 school years due to a change in academic standards. Moreover, our usual data for SAT scores by section is no longer available due to revisions in the test. Therefore, we are unable to present SAT testing data for the 2018-19 academic year. In 2019, graduation rates increased for the state of California, from 83.0% in the previous year to 84.5%, but decreased slightly for Santa Barbara County, from 87.4% to 86.8%. In addition, the dropout rate continued on a declining trend at the state level. Within the county however, the dropout rate reached 9.4% which was higher than the State level of 9.0%. The percentage of UC/CSU eligible graduates increased in both the county and the state with Santa Barbara county making a significant jump from 27.8% to 38.2%. It is important to note that collection methods for the graduation data used in the previously mentioned statistics changed in the 2016-17 school year when the California Department of Education began recording graduation rate and outcome data in a single aggregate data set as opposed to separate research files. This accounts for the striking increase in the dropout rate between 2015 and 2016. As a result, years after 2016 are not comparable to years prior to 2016. 7.4 Environment Key Points: Rainfall increased substantially in 2019, pulling Santa Barbara Country out of a drought Total energy use in Santa Barbara County was down in 2019 Water levels in Santa Barbara County remained stable in 2019 2019 only had one ozone exceedance day, one of the lowest levels since 1990 7.4.1 Annual Rainfall 2019 has a substantial increase in total rainfall, experiencing 132% of normal water-year rainfall, measured from September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019. 2019 is a “Wet Year” – defined as a year that has received more than 80% of normal rain. Santa Barbara County no longer remained in a drought, after a large increase in rainfall since 2018. Santa Barbara City, Santa Ynez, and Santa Maria, saw substantial increases in rainfall compared to 2018, which was a dry year. Santa Barbara City received 25.85 inches of rainfall, 43% above its mean annual rainfall of 18.12 inches. Santa Maria saw 15.97 inches of rain, 22% above its mean annual rainfall of 13.07 inches. Lastly, Santa Ynez received 20.07 inches of rain, 27% above its mean annual rainfall of 15.84. The 2019 water-year marks a return to above average rainfall for all three cities after 2018 saw below average rainfall in all three cities. 7.4.2 Water Reservoirs Cachuma reservoir, Gibraltar reservoir, and Jameson reservoir are Santa Barbara County’s major reservoirs for water. After 2018’s below average rainfall, water levels in the three reservoirs declined towards the end of the 2018. However, the three reservoirs all saw an increase in their water levels in 2019. Reservoir levels are measured in acre-feet; one acre-foot is approximately 325,851 gallons. Cachuma is the largest reservoir with a capacity of 193,305 acre-feet. Over the last year, Cachuma reservoir experienced an increase in water storage, going from holding 33% of capacity, to holding 77%. Jameson reservoir moved from carrying 58% to 90% of its maximum water levels of 4,848 acre-feet. Lastly, the smallest reservoir, Gibraltar was the only major reservoir to experience a decrease in water storage, going from 78% to 59% capacity over the year. 7.4.3 Water Consumption In 2018, the amount of gallons of water consumed per day for residential purposes within Santa Barbara County increased by an average of 3.7% across all cities. Water consumption had been declining in the County since 2013, largely driven by regulation due to the drought. Montecito had the highest percentage increase from 2017 to 2018 of 8.29%; on the other hand, Casmalia and Cuyama decreased their water consumption by 9.3% and 5%, respectively. Personal daily water consumption varies widely between cities, with Santa Ynez and Montecito at 242 and 222 gallons per day respectively, and Goleta at 52 gallons per day: the lowest consumption figure in the county. 7.4.4 Air Quality The Santa Barbara Air Pollution Control District has a network of monitoring stations to record the concentration of various air pollutants. Air quality is presented in terms of the number of days the ozone level exceeded the state 8-hour standard of .070 parts per million. In the long view, Santa Barbara County has experienced air quality improvements, which can be seen in the declining number of state 1-hours and 8-hour ozone exceedances that have occurred between 1990 and 2019. Neither 2018 or 2019 experienced any days where ozone levels exceeded the state 1-hour standard. However, 2019 experienced 1 ozone exceedance day where the ozone level exceeded the state 8-hour standard while 2018 had none. 2019’s 1 exceedance day marks one of the lowest levels since 1990, when the number of state 8-hour ozone exceedance days was 87. The attainment designation of the California Clean Air Act monitors whether Santa Barbara air meets certain health standards. These standards tell us how much of a substance can be in the air without causing harm, based on proven medical research. In order to be designated attainment for the state ozone standard, the data must show that the standard was not violated during the previous three calendar years. With 1 exceedance day in 2019, which went up from 0 exceedance days in 2018, Santa Barbara Country will still need three calendar years of not violating the standard in order to have reached attainment for the state ozone standard. 7.4.5 Electricity Consumption Santa Barbara County’s energy use dropped by 0.29% in 2018, following a declining trend and hitting a new 15 year low of 2,791 gigawatt hours. Most of the decrease is attributed to the residential energy use decreasing by 1.32%. Conversely, non-residential energy increased by only 0.00094%. Environmentally, conservation of energy helps maintain the quality of the environment and reduces pollution. We should expect to continue seeing a decrease in energy consumption as Santa Barbara County establishes its own renewable sources to achieve 100% sustainable energy goals by 2030 – as voted on by the City Council in June 2017.
