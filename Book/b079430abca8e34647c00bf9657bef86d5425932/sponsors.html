<p>Harold and Betty Hutton, entrepreneurs, adventurers and business partners, began their business as a small refining operation in Long Beach in the early 1950s and by the middle of the 70’s became a leading exporter of oil and natural gas from South East Asia.</p>
<p>In 1975, while living and working in Indonesia, Harold Hutton passed away suddenly. After his death, Betty decided to close the company’s oil operation in South East Asia and return to her roots in Orange, California. It was there, following a short retirement, that she established Hutton Companies, a commercial real estate development corporation.</p>
<p>In 1984, Betty Hutton asked Tom Parker to assume a management role at Hutton Companies. Together, Tom and Betty worked to grow and stabilize Hutton Companies as well as to fund and activate the Foundation.
Betty Hutton passed away unexpectedly in September of 1995. Since then, Hutton Parker Foundation has maintained its mission of striving to make a difference in the communities it serves through funding programs that support nonprofit sustainability and longevity.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation has grown into one of the largest private family foundations located in Santa Barbara County. The Foundation owns and operates many commercial properties providing office space to more than 60 local area nonprofits agencies. In addition, Hutton Parker Foundation awards nearly $4 million in grants, donations and discounted rent to approximately 300 nonprofit organizations annually.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include: Arts &amp; Culture, Education, Health &amp; Human Services, Children, Youth &amp; Families, and Civic &amp; Community. Funding programs include: Core Operating Support, Marketing &amp; Media Grants, Endowment and Capital Support.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation strives to provide organizational sustainability to community-based nonprofit organizations throughout Santa Barbara County and to assist agencies in achieving their highest level of performance and delivery of services resulting in stronger, more efficient communities for all.
The Foundation specializes in providing quality office space for local area nonprofit organizations through the acquisition and development of commercial real estate properties.</p>

<p>Frank Schipper Construction Co. is a local general contractor with strong ties to the
subcontractor and supplier community. We are members of several associations, including
the Associated General Contractors of California Tri-Counties District, the Santa Maria
Valley Contractors Association, the Santa Barbara Contractors Association, and the
Ventura County Contractors Association. We believe in giving qualified local
subcontractors and suppliers every opportunity to compete for community work.</p>
<p>Since 1982, Frank Schipper Construction Co. has provided exceptional preconstruction
and general contracting services to clients in the Tri-Counties. With over 40 years of
experience, our team ensures compliance with city regulations and maintains strong
relationships with local building o/icials. Most of our projects are carried out using
negotiated contracts with a Guaranteed Maximum Price; however, we also handle a limited
number of hard-bid fixed-price agreements. We firmly believe that collaborative
relationships among owners, design teams, and contractors lead to the most successful
projects. Our expertise includes conceptual budgeting and estimating, high-level project
documentation and reporting, logistics, and staging. Clients continually return to us for
future projects due to our skill in preconstruction services and planning.</p>
<p>Our journey began in the 1960s when our founder started building houses to create his own
business. In 1982, Frank Schipper established the company with core values of integrity,
teamwork, and professionalism. These values have contributed to many successful and
award-winning projects and an extensive base of repeat clients.</p>
<p>In 2015, Frank Schipper Construction Co. became 100% employee-owned. This ownership
stake motivates employees to enhance quality and productivity while holding themselves
accountable. Employee ownership is the foundation of our company’s culture and vision.</p>
<p>Frank Schipper Construction Co. has constructed or renovated many landmarks across
Santa Barbara and the Central Coast. We have collaborated with various industries,
including healthcare, arts and education, high-tech and clean rooms, commercial
interiors, historical renovations, non-profit organizations, and hospitality. Some of our
current clients include Sanctuary Centers, the Foodbank of Santa Barbara County, the

<p>Alamar Capital Management, LLC is an independent, Registered Investment Advisor in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
<p>Alamar manages a proprietary portfolio of individual stocks in the most attractive phase of their growth. These stocks carry very low weightings in passive indexes. Due to its high active share nature, this approach acts as a complement and an alternative to existing passive investments. To reduce risk and/or generate income, we utilize our Diversified strategy to gain exposure to additional asset classes.</p>
<p>For select families we act as a de facto family office, and are able to provide
oversight and performance monitoring for accounts that are not directly under our management, as well as measure the effectiveness of additional outside investments, such as private equity and real estate.</p>
<p>Alamar believes our interests must be aligned with the clients we serve. As a result, we make meaningful personal investments in the strategies we manage.</p>
