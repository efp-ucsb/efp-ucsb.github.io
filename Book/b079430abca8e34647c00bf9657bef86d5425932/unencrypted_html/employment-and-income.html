<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Santa Barbara County Employment<a href="employment-and-income.html#santa-barbara-county-employment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries continued to grow in 2022. Total Employment increased from 207,158 jobs in 2021 to 215,891 jobs in 2022. This gain of 8,733 workers represents an increase of 4.22%, which is lower than the previous year’s growth rate of 4.86%. Since December of 2012, Santa Barbara County has a net gain of 18,758 jobs, averaging an increase of 1,876 jobs each year. This is a sign that the labor markets in Santa Barbara County are healthy.</p>
<p>Nonfarm payroll in California increased in 2022, at a rate of 4.86%. Since December of 2012, nonfarm payrolls have increased in California by 11.49%. United States nonfarm payroll has also increased at a rate of 3.74%. This is significantly higher than the 2020 growth rate of -0.47%. Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll growth increased by 4.22%, which is slightly lower compared to California. This is higher than the 2020 growth rate of -0.64%. Nonfarm payroll is indexed to July 2009, and since the end of the recession, Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll gains (6.95%) have been higher than the United States’ (13.16%), but significantly lower than California’s (13.88%).</p>

<p>The average number of unemployed workers and the unemployment rate has also improved in the past year. The unemployment rate dropped from a peak of 14.6% in 2020 to, based on the most recent data, 3.6% in 2022. The number unemployed, defined as workers who are without work and are actively seeking work, has declined from a peak of 12,700 in 2020, to 2,932 in 2021, and then down to 7,816 in 2022. This drop of -4,884 unemployed workers in the past year represents a decline of -38.5%. The declines in both variables have been gradually slowing down as the labor market returns to so-called “full employment”, loosely defined as the lowest possible level that will not cause inflation. If unemployment falls significantly, inflation will rise as employers compete to hire workers and push up wages too fast. The size of the labor force in Santa Barbara County has increased from 2021 to 2022 by 3,850 workers. This is a small increase of 1.75%.</p>

<p>The next three figures show employment growth for 12 industries in Santa Barbara County over the past year, three years and ten years. The height of each bar shows the growth rate and the width shows the percent of total employment for each industry for 2018, 2016, and 2009 respectively.

<p>Over the past three years, Total Wage and Salary saw the largest increase in employment, with a three-year growth rate of 4.45%. Government and Total Wage and Salary have seen employment declines over the past three years with declines of -13.28% and -2.83% respectively.</p>
<p>Since 2012, the percent of total employment for most industries has not significantly changed. Total Wage and Salary has grown the most, as it now has an employment share of 4.45%. Total Farm has increased its employment share from 5.71% to 7.87% as it now has the fifth largest employment share.</p>
<p>Employment shares by industry have generally stayed the same within the past twenty years. The largest increase since 2002 is in the Total Wage and Salary industry, as their employment share has risen from 59.85% to 59.85%. Goods Producing, Government, Retail Trade, Manufacturing, and Financial Services have seen small declines since 2002.</p>
<p>The figures below depict the employment time series for the following industries: Total Nonfarm, Total Farm, Goods Producing, Services Providing, and the six largest 2-digit industries in Santa Barbara County. The dark blue line shows the original data series reported by the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the light blue line shows the seasonally adjusted data that the EFP has created. Some industries’ employment, like Total Farm, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Retail Trade, appear to be highly seasonal. Other industries, like Manufacturing and Education and Health Services, have almost no seasonal component. Employment in Leisure and Hospitality, Education and Health Services, and Professional and Business Services are all enjoying upward trends over this period. Employment in Goods Producing and Manufacturing has also seen recent upward trends after realizing declines after the Recession. Employment in Retail Trade has been declining since peaking in 2015.</p>

Santa Barbara’s labor market compares well to most counties in California. However, they aren’t as strong as some counties in Northern California, and specifically those counties in the Bay Area.

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nonfarm Payrolls are expected to grow at a rate of 1.42% in the upcoming year, an increase of 3,173 jobs. While this growth rate is high by historical standards, it is lower than the 4.46% growth observed in 2021.</li>
<li>Our statistical forecast suggests a 2022 December unemployment rate of 3.15%, a decrease of -0.37 percentage points compared with December 2021. The 95% confidence interval spans from a low of -0.75% to a high of 7.05%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The forecasting methods used in this section are based on the Census Bureau’s X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Their program can be used to forecast a series using only its statistical features. Each employment series has a seasonal component (the December effect for retail trade is one example), a trend component (like the long-run downward trend in goods-producing industries or a multi-year recession), and an irregular component (a one-month bump or decline in the series for reasons that will not occur again, like the 2012 Olympics producing a one-month bump in the London economy). After decomposing a time-series into these three components, the current trend component and seasonal component can be used to forecast the series. While the irregular series cannot be predicted, since it has an expected value of zero, and systematic changes to the trend and seasonal components also cannot be predicted, the history of how these components have varied in the past can be used to generate confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Each figure in this section shows the recent unadjusted and seasonally adjusted series followed by a three-year forecast. This forecast describes the most likely values for the unadjusted series. The dashed lines surrounding the forecast describe the 95% confidence interval. There is a 5% chance that values will occur outside of these dashed lines. Unless otherwise noted, each of the following year-over-year projections that we describe in the text will be between 2022 and 2023 for the unadjusted series.</p>

<p>In addition to providing data for individual occupations, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) also aggregates occupations into 22 occupation groups. A summary of the data for these occupation groups is provided in the following pages. largest occupation last year name is the largest occupation group, with 20,810 jobs, and second largest occupation group last year name is the second largest group, with 18,250 jobs. second largest occupation group last year name saw a significant 900.00% employment increase in 2021. The occupation group that saw the largest increase in employment is occupation group with largest percentage increase of employed last year. This group saw employment increase by an impressive 6,690 jobs, which is a 900.00% increase from 2021. This is likely the result of this sector rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual wages for the majority of occupations increased in 2021, with the exception of four occupation groups. occupation with largest wage increase last year had the largest wage increase of 106.23%. There was also strong growth in mean annual wage among Legal Occupations and Protective Service Occupations, each of which saw a gain of 12.9%.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real per capita income in Santa Barbara County rose in 2019 at 1.96%.</li>
