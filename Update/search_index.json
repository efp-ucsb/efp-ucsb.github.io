One key theme we like to stress when looking at this data is the need for seasonal adjustments. The raw data published by the BLS and EDD are not adjusted for seasonality, making month-by-month comparisons of certain economic time series potentially misleading. Santa Barbara County is home to a large agricultural sector, a very seasonal industry. For example, spikes in unemployment at the end of harvesting season might, to some, suggest a negative economic indicator. This spike, however, could very much be less pronounced than in previous years, and should be seen more positively. Seasonally adjusting these time series accomplishes this. It removes these transitory fluctuations so that appropriate, pragmatic conclusions can be made when looking at the data. 1.1 Detailed Data Below you will find a more detailed breakdown of the employment data for Santa Barbara County. In particular, we present employment estimates from multiple sources, employment broken down by industry, unemployment estimates for the county and disaggregated by sub-county places (cities, CDPs, etc.), and estimates for the overall labor force more generally (i.e. those individuals who are either employed or actively looking for work). We present some of the same data for the neighboring Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties. Finally, you will also find data below pertaining to the tri-county area and the relative performance of Santa Barbara Counties with the neighboring Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties, and the aggregate economy more generally. 1.2 Santa Barbara County 1.2.1 Santa Barbara Industries 1.2.2 Santa Barbara Sub-County Places 1.3 Ventura County 1.3.1 Ventura Industries 1.4 San Luis Obispo County 1.4.1 San Luis Obispo Industries 1.5 Comparison 1.5.1 Aggregate Comparison 1.5.2 Tri-County Comparison "],["realestate.html", "2 Real Estate 2.1 Zillow Home Value Index 2.2 Santa Barbara County Recorder’s Data", " 2 Real Estate 2.1 Zillow Home Value Index One of the hallmarks of the Great Recession was its profound effect on housing markets nationwide. Since then the health of these markets have garnered significant attention and has been used as an indicator of potential future downturns. Since the downturn, most housing markets in the Western United States have, in fact, recovered. Colorado has seen exceptional growth and is now 60% higher than its pre-recession peak. The recovery of the California housing market is reflected across much of the state. Overall, Californian homes are worth $547,400, roughly 1% above their pre-recession peaks. Over the metropolitan areas shown below, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego have seen the largest recovery. Within Santa Barbara County, Santa Barbara City and Montecito have both more than recovered from the Great Recession. Many of the others, however, remain below. The slowdown in growth of the California housing market has also been felt by Santa Barbara County’s cities. Save for recent trends in Goleta, many other cities have seen a slow decline in the growth of home values. 2.2 Santa Barbara County Recorder’s Data South Santa Barbara County Month Count Avg Sales Price Avg Price Change Median Price Median Price Change Feb 2020 141 $1,415,883 3.4% $1,058,500 8.9% Feb 2021 169 $2,159,444 52.5% $1,300,000 22.8% Feb 2022 138 $2,448,246 13.4% $1,715,500 32% Feb 2023 79 $2,298,487 6.1% $1,405,500 -18.1% Feb 2024 99 $2,848,146 23.9% $1,400,000 -0.4% South Santa Barbara County Month Count Avg Sales Price Avg Price Change Median Price Median Price Change Jan-Feb 2020 276 $1,385,341 16.1% $1,052,500 4.2% Jan-Feb 2021 341 $2,078,924 50.1% $1,285,000 22.1% Jan-Feb 2022 259 $2,463,550 18.5% $1,535,000 19.5% Jan-Feb 2023 156 $2,349,949 4.6% $1,415,250 -7.8% Jan-Feb 2024 190 $2,633,495 12.1% $1,575,000 11.3% North Santa Barbara County Month Count Avg Sales Price Avg Price Change Median Price Median Price Change Feb 2020 340 $445,426 8.6% $401,500 6.4% Feb 2021 330 $650,091 45.9% $480,000 19.6% Feb 2022 346 $658,038 1.2% $561,000 16.9% Feb 2023 93 $678,429 3.1% $555,000 -1.1% Feb 2024 130 $760,215 12.1% $617,500 11.3% North Santa Barbara County Month Count Avg Sales Price Avg Price Change Median Price Median Price Change Jan-Feb 2020 764 $458,513 3.4% $406,000 7.1% Jan-Feb 2021 688 $612,254 33.5% $475,000 17% Jan-Feb 2022 702 $682,799 11.5% $565,000 18.9% Jan-Feb 2023 195 $736,128 7.8% $565,000 0% Jan-Feb 2024 232 $709,494 3.6% $610,000 8% "],["overview.html", "Overview", " Overview The Economic Forecast Project was established in 1981 by the Department of Economics at UC Santa Barbara to provide the community with information on economic, demographic, and regional business trends in the Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura County areas. Our primary research activity is the collection and verification of statistical data and other evidence about the changing business and economic environment in our county. The UCSB Economic Forecast Project monitors the status of the economy and provides clear, comprehensive analysis of economic trends in the local area. The Forecast Project is a self-supporting research program, administered by the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor. Oversight is provided by two Advisory Boards of Directors, one representing the business community of South Santa Barbara County and one representing the business community of North Santa Barbara County. "],["mission-statement.html", "Mission Statement", " Mission Statement The Economic Forecast Project is a University of California, Santa Barbara community-sponsored research department. The purpose of the Project is to provide detailed economic and demographic data and analysis to citizens, government agencies, businesses, non-profits, and other users. To this end, EFP maintains extensive databases and models of Santa Barbara County and the Central Coast. Our research is presented to local communities via the internet, publications, and events held across the Santa Barbara region throughout the year. Any individual or entity operating in an economy as unique and dynamic as that of the Central Coast needs to be informed of important economic and demographic trends from multiple sources with multiple perspectives. The UCSB Economic Forecast Project exists to provide the data, research, and analysis to inform those individuals and entities. We strive to present our work in the accurate, coherent and detailed manner possible.
