We are a true community bank founded and owned by our customers who are local business people, non-profits, investors and entrepreneurs.

Since 1850, Santa Barbara County government has a history of providing excellent and responsive public service while operating under sound fiscal principles. County government is comprised of 21 departments and agencies, and a 4,200-person workforce that strive to provide for the health and safety of residents and visitors. The Board of Supervisors is the legislative and executive body of Santa Barbara government, comprised of five elected officials representing each of the county supervisory districts. Departments make recommendations to the Board and implement its actions. The Sheriff-Coroner, District Attorney, Clerk-Recorder-Assessor, Treasurer-Tax Collector-Public Administrator, and Auditor-Controller are independently elected offices. The vital role of County government became all the more clear in late 2017 with the Thomas Fire followed by the devastating debris flow on January 9, 2018. The idea of community and resiliency took on new meaning as members of the public, private and nonprofit sectors came together to respond to the monumental task of providing support for those impacted, ensuring public safety and rebuilding a vital, healthy community for residents and visitors alike. The $1.1 billion adopted Fiscal Year 2018-19 budget provides funding for important initiatives, ongoing and new mandates and liabilities, and increased levels of funding for prior Board commitments – all within the context of recovering from one of the largest disasters the County has encountered in recent history. In 2018, the state of California provided $1.4 million in one-time funding to back-fill the County’s property tax losses incurred in 2017-18 and 2018-19 because of the fire and debris flow disasters. The Board assigned these funds and an additional $4.5 million to repay 94 percent of the $6.3 million pulled from the County’s Strategic Reserve for disaster response activities. Despite the challenges, the County continues to build a better government that is responsive and accountable. In 2018, the Board approved moving forward on more than 100 initiatives generated by Renew 2022, a multi-year program to re-vision and transform Santa Barbara County government by the year 2022 and beyond.

The results of this vision are many and include a hard working, high quality and fiscally sound organization with objective goals and measurable achievements. Since 1969, the Housing Authority has developed and/or secured over 4,000 units of affordable rental housing for Santa Barbara through a variety of programs, including workforce housing, public housing, congregate living facilities for frail seniors, supportive housing for the homeless as well as the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. Through Section 8 alone, the Housing Authority infuses over $32 million per year in federal tax revenue to the South Coast economy. The Authority’s dedicated Board of Commissioners and staff ensure that HACSB continues to be a well-managed, compassionate and effective affordable housing and service provider. In 2007, the Housing Authority of the City of Santa Barbara formed an affiliate non-profit, 2nd Story Associates out of the recognition of a growing unmet need for sufficient affordable housing and expanded resident service programs for low-Income families, seniors and disabled individuals in Santa Barbara. 2nd Story’s programs promote a holistic service approach to low income households by promoting educational opportunities for children, economic advancement for adults and overall self-sufficiency programs for entire families. 2nd Story has also become instrumental in the funding and development of new affordable housing. As an affiliate non-profit, they have helped the Housing Authority access certain forms of financing that is not always available to public agencies. The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara is founded on the belief that decent, safe and sanitary housing is central to the physical and emotional health, productivity, and self-esteem of the people it serves. Our mission is primarily to build, acquire, own, manage and maintain residential rental units for persons of extremely low, very low and low-income and to obtain rent payment assistance for similar households renting in the private market. Operating through a central Administrative Office in Lompoc and Housing Management and Maintenance offices in Goleta, Lompoc and Santa Maria, the Authority provides direct services to applicants, tenants and private property owners. In 2018, the Executive Director and staff will implement a combined agency-wide budget of approximately $50 million while serving 4,800 extremely low, very low and low-income households. Of the 4,800 households served, 3,400 are assisted in privately owned rentals through the federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, operated locally since 1975. The Authority also owns, manages and maintains 1,324 residential rental units throughout Santa Barbara County. The Housing Authority, since its creation in 1941, has undertaken new construction and acquisition development activities in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county. We partner with seven cities and the County of Santa Barbara to perform a variety of housing-related services in support of local plans. www.hasbarco.org Harold and Betty Hutton, entrepreneurs, adventurers and business partners, began their business as a small refining operation in Long Beach in the early 1950s and by the middle of the 70’s became a leading exporter of oil and natural gas from South East Asia. In 1975, while living and working in Indonesia, Harold Hutton passed away suddenly. After his death, Betty decided to close the company’s oil operation in South East Asia and return to her roots in Orange, California. It was there, following a short retirement, that she established Hutton Companies, a commercial real estate development corporation.

The business which was started out of necessity by Mario F Borgatello and his brother Charles Borgatello has evolved over time from a two man operation to over 350 employees. In 1911 Segundo and Josephine Borgatello immigrated to Santa Barbara, Californian from Asti, Italy. Within months of Segundo’s youngest child’s birth he passed away leaving Josephine to care for 5 very young children. She did what she could to support her family by working as a seamstress and taking in other immigrant workers from Italy into her home. The family struggled for many years and at very young ages the children did whatever jobs they could to help their mother survive financially. In the late 1930’s, Mario F Borgatello started a small business in the rural hills of Montecito, California. Together with his brother Charles they would walk great distances from house to house to collect food waste to feed the hogs that their mother was raising. Soon many of their customers asked them to start taking away all their trash items and hence a family business was started out of others people trash. In endeavoring to grow the seeds of recycling and preservation that were planted by Mario and Charles in the 1930’s, MarBorg has continued to be on the forefront of recycling technology. Through continued investment and innovation MarBorg has steadily increased the amount of material that they are able to process and recycle to 200,000 tons per year. Because of this continued effort and investment, MarBorg has become the largest private source of recycling for the Cities of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Buellton, UCSB and the County of Santa Barbara.

"],["employment.html", "1 Employment Update 1.1 Detailed Data 1.2 Santa Barbara County 1.3 Ventura County 1.4 San Luis Obispo County 1.5 Comparison", " 1 Employment Update The data presented in this section come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Economic Development Department of California (EDD). One key theme we like to stress when looking at this data is the need for seasonal adjustments. The raw data published by the BLS and EDD are not adjusted for seasonality, making month-by-month comparisons of certain economic time series potentially misleading. Santa Barbara County is home to a large agricultural sector, a very seasonal industry. For example, spikes in unemployment at the end of harvesting season might, to some, suggest a negative economic indicator. This spike, however, could very much be less pronounced than in previous years, and should be seen more positively. Seasonally adjusting these time series accomplishes this. It removes these transitory fluctuations so that appropriate, pragmatic conclusions can be made when looking at the data. 1.1 Detailed Data Below you will find a more detailed breakdown of the employment data for Santa Barbara County. In particular, we present employment estimates from multiple sources, employment broken down by industry, unemployment estimates for the county and disaggregated by sub-county places (cities, CDPs, etc.), and estimates for the overall labor force more generally (i.e. those individuals who are either employed or actively looking for work). We present some of the same data for the neighboring Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties. Finally, you will also find data below pertaining to the tri-county area and the relative performance of Santa Barbara Counties with the neighboring Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties, and the aggregate economy more generally. 1.2 Santa Barbara County 1.2.1 Santa Barbara Industries 1.2.2 Santa Barbara Sub-County Places 1.3 Ventura County 1.3.1 Ventura Industries 1.4 San Luis Obispo County 1.4.1 San Luis Obispo Industries 1.5 Comparison 1.5.1 Aggregate Comparison 1.5.2 Tri-County Comparison "],["realestate.html", "2 Real Estate 2.1 Zillow Home Value Index 2.2 Santa Barbara County Recorder’s Data", " 2 Real Estate 2.1 Zillow Home Value Index One of the hallmarks of the Great Recession was its profound effect on housing markets nationwide. Since then the health of these markets have garnered significant attention and has been used as an indicator of potential future downturns. Since the downturn, most housing markets in the Western United States have, in fact, recovered. Colorado has seen exceptional growth and is now 60% higher than its pre-recession peak. The recovery of the California housing market is reflected across much of the state. Overall, Californian homes are worth $547,400, roughly 1% above their pre-recession peaks. Over the metropolitan areas shown below, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego have seen the largest recovery. Within Santa Barbara County, Santa Barbara City and Montecito have both more than recovered from the Great Recession. Many of the others, however, remain below. The slowdown in growth of the California housing market has also been felt by Santa Barbara County’s cities.

Our primary research activity is the collection and verification of statistical data and other evidence about the changing business and economic environment in our county. The UCSB Economic Forecast Project monitors the status of the economy and provides clear, comprehensive analysis of economic trends in the local area. The Forecast Project is a self-supporting research program, administered by the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor. Oversight is provided by two Advisory Boards of Directors, one representing the business community of South Santa Barbara County and one representing the business community of North Santa Barbara County. "],["mission-statement.html", "Mission Statement", " Mission Statement The Economic Forecast Project is a University of California, Santa Barbara community-sponsored research department. The purpose of the Project is to provide detailed economic and demographic data and analysis to citizens, government agencies, businesses, non-profits, and other users. To this end, EFP maintains extensive databases and models of Santa Barbara County and the Central Coast. Our research is presented to local communities via the internet, publications, and events held across the Santa Barbara region throughout the year. Any individual or entity operating in an economy as unique and dynamic as that of the Central Coast needs to be informed of important economic and demographic trends from multiple sources with multiple perspectives. The UCSB Economic Forecast Project exists to provide the data, research, and analysis to inform those individuals and entities. We strive to present our work in the accurate, coherent and detailed manner possible.
