Harold and Betty Hutton, entrepreneurs, adventurers and business partners, began their business as a small refining operation in Long Beach in the early 1950s and by the middle of the 70’s became a leading exporter of oil and natural gas from South East Asia.</p>
<p>In 1975, while living and working in Indonesia, Harold Hutton passed away suddenly. After his death, Betty decided to close the company’s oil operation in South East Asia and return to her roots in Orange, California. It was there, following a short retirement, that she established Hutton Companies, a commercial real estate development corporation.</p>
<p>In 1984, Betty Hutton asked Tom Parker to assume a management role at Hutton Companies. Together, Tom and Betty worked to grow and stabilize Hutton Companies as well as to fund and activate the Foundation.
Betty Hutton passed away unexpectedly in September of 1995. Since then, Hutton Parker Foundation has maintained its mission of striving to make a difference in the communities it serves through funding programs that support nonprofit sustainability and longevity.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation has grown into one of the largest private family foundations located in Santa Barbara County. The Foundation owns and operates many commercial properties providing office space to more than 60 local area nonprofits agencies. In addition, Hutton Parker Foundation awards nearly $4 million in grants, donations and discounted rent to approximately 300 nonprofit organizations annually.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include: Arts &amp; Culture, Education, Health &amp; Human Services, Children, Youth &amp; Families, and Civic &amp; Community. Funding programs include: Core Operating Support, Marketing &amp; Media Grants, Endowment and Capital Support.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation strives to provide organizational sustainability to community-based nonprofit organizations throughout Santa Barbara County and to assist agencies in achieving their highest level of performance and delivery of services resulting in stronger, more efficient communities for all.
The Foundation specializes in providing quality office space for local area nonprofit organizations through the acquisition and development of commercial real estate properties.</p>

documentation and reporting, logistics, and staging. Clients continually return to us for
future projects due to our skill in preconstruction services and planning.</p>

teamwork, and professionalism. These values have contributed to many successful and
award-winning projects and an extensive base of repeat clients.</p>
