Harold and Betty Hutton, entrepreneurs, adventurers and business partners, began their business as a small refining operation in Long Beach in the early 1950s and by the middle of the 70’s became a leading exporter of oil and natural gas from South East Asia.</p>
<p>In 1975, while living and working in Indonesia, Harold Hutton passed away suddenly. After his death, Betty decided to close the company’s oil operation in South East Asia and return to her roots in Orange, California. It was there, following a short retirement, that she established Hutton Companies, a commercial real estate development corporation.</p>
<p>In 1984, Betty Hutton asked Tom Parker to assume a management role at Hutton Companies. Together, Tom and Betty worked to grow and stabilize Hutton Companies as well as to fund and activate the Foundation.
Betty Hutton passed away unexpectedly in September of 1995. Since then, Hutton Parker Foundation has maintained its mission of striving to make a difference in the communities it serves through funding programs that support nonprofit sustainability and longevity.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation has grown into one of the largest private family foundations located in Santa Barbara County. The Foundation owns and operates many commercial properties providing office space to more than 60 local area nonprofits agencies. In addition, Hutton Parker Foundation awards nearly $4 million in grants, donations and discounted rent to approximately 300 nonprofit organizations annually.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include: Arts &amp; Culture, Education, Health &amp; Human Services, Children, Youth &amp; Families, and Civic &amp; Community. Funding programs include: Core Operating Support, Marketing &amp; Media Grants, Endowment and Capital Support.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation strives to provide organizational sustainability to community-based nonprofit organizations throughout Santa Barbara County and to assist agencies in achieving their highest level of performance and delivery of services resulting in stronger, more efficient communities for all.
The Foundation specializes in providing quality office space for local area nonprofit organizations through the acquisition and development of commercial real estate properties.</p>

projects. Our expertise includes conceptual budgeting and estimating, high-level project
documentation and reporting, logistics, and staging. Clients continually return to us for
future projects due to our skill in preconstruction services and planning.</p>

business. In 1982, Frank Schipper established the company with core values of integrity,
teamwork, and professionalism. These values have contributed to many successful and
award-winning projects and an extensive base of repeat clients.</p>

stake motivates employees to enhance quality and productivity while holding themselves
accountable. Employee ownership is the foundation of our company’s culture and vision.</p>

It’s not business. It’s personal.</p>
<p>Skill. Experience. Results. Yes, Radius Commercial Real Estate has the goods to deliver. But there’s much more to our approach to sales and leasing than checking all the boxes. So what makes us different?</p>
<p>The Radius Team is a squad of local commercial real estate enthusiasts (read: nerds). We get up in the morning excited about the cool stuff we get to do, how we do it, and the people we get to do it for.</p>
<p>In fact, ever since our motley crew came together in 2002, Radius has held firm to one basic principle: We represent your interests as if they were our own. That’s helped us push the boundaries of the commercial brokerage scene, cementing a reputation as a trusted industry expert and advisor.</p>
<p>Locally founded and operated, we are deeply invested in the Central Coast communities we serve. With offices in Santa Barbara and Ventura covering the full scope of the Tri-Counties and beyond, experts in every facet of commercial real estate including agricultural land and business brokering services, supported by a crack operations team armed with the finest information and marketing systems, Radius brings together an unrivaled brand of resourcefulness to consistently clinch the competitive advantage for our clients.</p>
<p>You see, when you bring on Radius, you’re not just hiring a broker. You’re getting a partner with real skin in the game who cares as much about your success as our own.</p>
<p>Because it’s never just about business. It’s personal.</p>
