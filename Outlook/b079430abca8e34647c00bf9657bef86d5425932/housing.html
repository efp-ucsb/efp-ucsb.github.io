<p>Santa Barbara County’s housing market continued its growth in terms of home values compared to last year, albeit at a slower rate. From March 2024 to March 2025, the Zillow County Level Prices, an estimate of the median home value, for Santa Barbara County increased from $958.8104k to $980.636k, a 2.276% change. The median home price in Santa Barbara County as of March 2025 surpassed its pre-recession high of $699k in June 2006. Median prices in both the overall US and California have remained above their pre-recession peaks. None of these geographies experienced gains in year-over-year growth rates of home values relative to this time last year. 2023 also saw a large dip in home value growth beginning in January, reaching a minimum between February and June, depending on the region under consideration. Growth and home values have since rebounded. Following the recovery in home value growth rates, i.e. since 2013, year-over-year growth of Santa Barbara County home values reached a minimum of 1.34% in December 2019. Neighboring San Luis Obispo County has fared worse, reaching a minimum of -0.89% in April 2023. Of particular interest is that, while the United States as a whole also experienced a dip of sorts throughout 2019, the decline and subsequent rebound in year-over-year growth is most dramatic for California. Given the size of California and the relative value of its housing market, the 2019 decline in California’s year-over-year growth may be a large contributing factor to the apparent nationwide dip during that time period.</p>
<p>Inventories, calculated as a index to evaluate how many houes are on the market in a given region, increased in both Santa Barbara County and California, following last year’s rebound. Santa Barbara experienced a decline in inventories from a peak in January 2019 to March 2020. This dip in inventories across the United States, while still present, is much smaller than that in both California and Santa Barbara County housing markets and appears to be a return to the Country’s secular trend in inventories beginning in 2013. Take note of the fact that declining inventories could be due to one or more of many different supply and demand forces, and how efficiently real estate markets match buyers with sellers. The health of local housing markets depends crucially on the source of the change in inventories and not simply the stock of inventories itself.</p>
<div id="affordability" class="section level3" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Affordability</h3>
<p>The Housing Affordability Index from the California Association of Realtors measures the percentage of households in California counties that can afford to purchase the median-priced home in their respective areas. Nationally, 36% of United States households could afford the median-priced home in the country during the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase from 35% in the same quarter of the previous year. California’s Housing Affordability Index remains lower than the national average, with 15% of households able to afford the median-priced home in the state during Q4 2024, unchanged from the same quarter in 2023. Santa Barbara County also falls below the national average, with an index of 10%. This represents a decrease from 11% in Q4 2023 and is unchanged from Q3 2024. Moreover, Santa Barbara County is among the least affordable counties in California, tied with Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties at 10%. Only Mono County had a lower affordability index at 6%.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Housing Prices and Sales</h3>
<p>Home price data from the California Association of Realtors shows that the real median home price for Santa Barbara County increased by approximately 2.3% between March 2024 and March 2025. This compares to a 3.5% rise in real prices for California and a 3.7% increase for Los Angeles County.​ When examining different regions within Santa Barbara County, the South Coast experienced a median home price increase of 1.9%, while North County saw a more substantial rise of 3.1% over the same period.​ These figures suggest a modest appreciation in home values across Santa Barbara County, with North County outpacing the South Coast in terms of growth.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Sales Price vs. List Price</h3>
<p>When comparing list prices and sales prices, the median sales price for single family homes is close to the median list price throughout Santa Barbara County. In 2007, no areas in Santa Barbara City and Goleta sold homes at a discount. Instead, SB/East of State, SB/Gol North, SB/Gol South, and SB/West of State sold single family homes at a premium. The differences in list and sale prices may be indicative of the relative bargaining power of buyers and sellers in each region. Throughout the County, the lowest sale to list price was 117% in SB/West of State. List prices vary significantly between regions, with Hope Ranch being the most expensive and SB/Gol South being the least expensive. Median list prices for these two geographies are $3,955,625 and $876,917, respectively.</p>

<p>Montecito experienced the largest level change in its median sale price, which rose in 2024 from $5,005,005 to $5,500,000. This brings its median home price back in line with historic prices after a stark rise in 2018. This level change also represents the largest percentage change in median home prices, adjusting by 9.89%. Santa Barbara North County had the most stable prices in percentage terms, with median home prices increasing by 2.3% between 2024 and 2025. In terms of mean home prices, Montecito experienced the largest change: average prices rose from $6,433,806 to $6,800,000. Given that the median price saw a modest increase, it is likely the case that a small number of high-value sales is skewing the average for the Montecito area.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooling Q1 sales underscore more selective approach in south coast commercial purchasing</li>
</ul>
<p>The first quarter of 2025 saw a noticeable slowdown in commercial sales across the South Coast, with only 12 recorded transactions totaling just under $34 million in volume. This marks a significant decline from the $64.75 million in Q1 of 2024 and continues the post-2022 trend of cooling activity after a record-breaking year. While the number of deals and overall dollar volume were down, the quarter still reflected investor interest in select, highquality properties across a mix of asset types. Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The largest sale of the quarter was an office property at 29 W. Calle Laureles. in Santa Barbara, which closed for $4.6 million or $605/SF.</p></li>
<li><p>The highest price-per-square-foot for a building went to 730 Anacapa St., a boutique office that sold for $1,372/SF, showing that well-located downtown properties still command a premium despite broader market caution.</p></li>
<li><p>Office properties led the quarter in volume, with four (4) sales contributing over $15.7 million combined, including both
investor and owner-user purchases.</p></li>
<li><p>On the retail side, we saw impressive price-per-square-foot metrics in Goleta, particularly the sale at 5999 Hollister Ave., which sold for over $1,100/SF—a standout number even in today’s market.</p></li>
<li><p>Industrial properties traded hands at more modest prices, with activity centered in the Santa Barbara core.</p></li>
<li><p>There were a few notable land transactions, including a multifamily development site at 1103 Bailard Ave. in Carpinteria which sold for $4.2 million—an indicator of continuing interest in long-term development plays, albeit at lower price points (around $30/SF for land).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While these numbers represent open-market deals, we also saw two large institutional REIT transactions totaling over $102 million, involving retail centers in Santa Barbara and Carpinteria. However, these were essentially internal REIT acquisitions and not considered part of traditional investor activity, so we’ve excluded them from our totals.
Looking at the five-year history, Q1 2025 dropped us down to early pandemic levels in terms of both volume and transaction count, with both 2021 and 2021 recording about $39 million each year with 12 and 15 sales respectively. While buyer demand has clearly cooled since the highs of 2022, we’re seeing a more normalized, steady pace of activity with selective interest in well-located assets. Properties that are unique, turnkey, or income-producing continue to perform well, while others are sitting longer or trading below ask. Interest rate sensitivity and cautious underwriting remain dominant themes, but confidence hasn’t disappeared—it’s just more measured.</p>

<div id="office" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.1</span> Office</h4>
<p>Not much change in Santa Barbara with the office vacancy rate continuing to hover between 10% and 11%. Interesting to note when you look at achieved office lease rates in Santa Barbara we are near an all-time high at about $3.40/SF gross. Why? Most of what is leasing is smaller, high-end space which tends to rent at a higher price/SF. The largest lease of the quarter involved a non-profit taking 5,500 SF at 602 Anacapa St. Another notable lease involved a veterinary group taking 5,000 SF at 4860 Calle Real. Ever since COVID veterinarian groups have continued to do well. Regrettably, Umbra Labs decided to vacate their nearly 28,000 SF space at 419 State St. and move to Goleta, putting another large tech office space on the market.</p>
<p><img src="figs/radius3.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Moving on to Goleta, the office vacancy rate ticked up slightly to 8.1%,
keeping Goleta the tightest office market in the South Coast (Santa
Barbara, Carpinteria and Goleta). Lease rates for higher-end office
space in Goleta continue to rise. For the four new leases over 3,000
SF signed during Q1, lease rates ranged from $1.62 - $1.85/SF NNN. As
noted in previous reports, the three largest office spaces for lease in
Goleta remain subleases of 43,655 SF, 29,372 SF and 22,964 SF.
Finally in Carpinteria, the office vacancy rate decreased slightly to
25.6% during Q1, with just one new lease signed. Forgeline Solutions
took 8,560 SF on the bluffs. This was formerly occupied by ProCore,
who continues to have about 80,000 square feet available for sublease.</p>
</div>
<div id="industrial" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.2</span> Industrial</h4>
<p>The first quarter 2025 was very quiet for industrial leasing with only
4 new leases signed. The big news was a new 22,000 SF lease at
1120 Mark Ave. in Carpinteria, formerly occupied by Bright Rentals.
The space leased to Mesa Energy. Also in Carpinteria, Gigavac put
their 40,274 SF at 6382 Rose Ln. on the market for sublease. This
moves the vacancy rate in Carpinteria to just over 3%, however that
represents only two lease offerings in the Carpinteria submarket.
Meanwhile Santa Barbara basically remained flat at
about a 1% vacancy rate with only two spaces over
10,000 SF on the market and a total of just under 50,000
SF available. Goleta’s vacancy rate increased slightly
to 3.3% with seven spaces over 10,000 SF now on the
market for lease. Both Q1 2025 and Q4 2024 were quiet
with regard to larger industrial space leasing activity.
Lease rates throughout the South Coast are stable,
however larger industrial tenants will have more leverage
in light of the increased options on the market.</p>
</div>
<div id="retail" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.3</span> Retail</h4>
<p>Retail leasing activity in Santa Barbara continued to
soften in the first quarter of 2025. While the 12 new retail
leases signed in Q1 surpassed the eight (8) recorded in
Q4 2024, total absorption remained modest, with just
17,512 SF removed from the market. The trend of stronger
demand for smaller retail spaces persisted, while larger
spaces remained increasingly difficult to lease.
The largest lease of the quarter was a 3,081 SF space
at 1230 State St., secured by Pascucci’s—a downtown
fixture for 31 years. The restaurant will relocate from the
500 block, and while the lease is not notable for its size,
the continued presence of long-standing operators on
State Street is an encouraging sign for the city.
Two additional leases were completed on the 900 block
of State Street, at 909 and 911.5 State, contributing
to revitalization efforts on a block that has struggled
with persistent vacancies. Meanwhile, 805 University
relocated from 920 State St. to Paseo Nuevo,
exemplifying how short-term leases can serve as interim
solutions while long-term plans for this key downtown
development take place.
Larger retail vacancies, however, remain a challenge.
The former Nordstrom building at 817 State St. is now
marketing its entire 33,053 SF first floor as available
retail space, further increasing the inventory of large-
format retail downtown.
Outside of downtown, Hook Line and Sinker—a local
staple in the fishing community since 1976—signed a
five-year lease at Las Positas Center. Montecito also
saw two new leases, including Marisa Mason at The
Post (1805 E. Cabrillo Blvd.) who currently operates at
Arlington Plaza on the 1300 block of State.
Overall, Santa Barbara’s retail vacancy rate inched up
from 3.2% in Q4 2024 to 3.3% in Q1 2025. While the
increase was slight, it marks a noticeable rise from the
2.0% vacancy rate reported in Q2 2023. Asking rents rose
slightly from $4.06/SF to $4.18/SF (gross equivalent), while
achieved rents dropped from $3.85/SF to $2.99/SF—excluding
higher-priced Montecito leases. This decline in achieved rents
was driven by a handful of deals at below-market rates.
The continuation of small businesses accounting for the vast
majority of Q1 leases highlights the vital role locally owned
operators play in Santa Barbara’s retail landscape. While
national tenants do maintain a presence, the data clearly
reflects that small businesses are the primary engine driving the
local retail economy.</p>
</div>
<div id="west-ventura-county-conejo-valley-office" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.4</span> West Ventura County / Conejo Valley Office</h4>
<p>The West Ventura County and Conejo Valley office vacancy rate continued to rise in Q1 2025, increasing to 25.9% and bringing
total available space to over 3.55MM SF. Despite a modest uptick in activity with approximately 150,000 SF in new leases
signed, the market remains sluggish and well below historical leasing averages.</p>
<p><strong>The three largest contiguous availabilities remain:</strong>
- 225 E. Hillcrest Dr., Thousand Oaks – 121K RSF
- 112 S. Lakeview Canyon Rd., Westlake Village – 133K RSF
- 5601 Lindero Canyon Rd., Westlake Village – 99K RSF</p>
</div>
<div id="w.-ventura-county-retail" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.5">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.5</span> W. Ventura County Retail</h4>
<p>West Ventura County’s retail market in Q1 2025 maintained steady momentum with 53 new leases signed compared to 56 in
Q4 2024. High demand persisted for second-generation restaurant spaces, pad sites and junior box positions, though vacancy
rates rose to 7.0% with over 200,000 SF of new space flooding the market from closures like $.99 only, Big Lots, Party City
and Forever 21. The vacancy rate would be even higher without merchants like Five Below and Dollar Tree signing on to occupy
some of the Party City and $.99 only boxes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the average monthly asking lease rate held steady at $2.43/SF with 1.5% annual growth.
The largest new lease of the quarter was Tractor Supply Company’s 46,817 SF at 2975 Johnson Dr. in Ventura. Two other
notable leases include Action Academy children’s gymnastics club taking on 7,306 SF in Moorpark; and Asian Fusion Cuisine
signing on for 6,700 SF in Thousand Oaks, a sizable footprint particularly amid the current market where restaurant spaces
typically range from 1,500 SF – 2,500 SF.</p>
<p>Moving on to sales activity in the retail sector, the first quarter saw a blend of small cash deals with major portfolio
transactions, underscoring Ventura County’s resilient and attractive retail investment landscape. One key sales transaction
was the $11.9 million sale of Channel Islands Marketplace (1731–1741 Ventura Blvd., Oxnard) at $371.29/SF with a 6.45% Cap
rate. This shopping center includes tenants like Guitar Center and Mattress Firm. Ownership recently tore down an existing
6,000 SF building and ground-leased the land to Starbucks which helped lower the overall Cap rate.
Additionally, Blackstone Inc.’s $4 billion acquisition of ROIC (Retail Opportunity Investments Corp.) in February added grocery-
anchored centers like Seabridge Marketplace in Oxnard, Park Oaks in Thousand Oaks, North Ranch in Westlake, and Moorpark
Town Center to its portfolio, further reinforcing investor confidence in Ventura County’s stable retail landscape.</p>
</div>
<div id="santa-barbara-south-county-5-units" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.6">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.6</span> Santa Barbara South County | 5+ Units</h4>
<p>The first quarter of 2025 showed a significant shift in market dynamics
for multifamily properties in Santa Barbara South County. While
demand remained relatively strong, we saw a notable decrease in
transaction volume compared to the robust activity of Q4 2024, with
only five (5) transactions recorded in Q1 for properties with 5+ units
(including Isla Vista), compared to 2024’s average of 8.5 per quarter.
One of the two standout transactions for the quarter was at 20-80
Oceano Ave. in Santa Barbara, a 29-unit oceanfront property on the
Mesa adjacent to Santa Barbara City College, that sold for $21,150,000
($729,310/Unit) at a 4.68% CAP rate. This property featured a mix
of unit types, with most apartments enjoying full oceanfront views,
including 9 existing short-term rentals. The seller provided financing
on this transaction, helping to facilitate the deal despite challenging
market conditions.
The second standout transaction was 27 E. Gutierrez St., a mixed-use
property acquired by UC Santa Barbara as part of the university’s
strategic expansion into downtown Santa Barbara. This property,
located at the intersection of State and Gutierrez streets, represents
a significant institutional investment aimed at strengthening UCSB’s
presence in the community and supporting State Street’s revitalization
efforts. The purchase, approved by the UC Board of Regents in
November 2024, closed in January 2025 at an undisclosed price.
Another transaction in South County was at 1605 Bath St., Santa
Barbara, a 10-unit property that sold for $2,400,000 ($240,000/Unit)
at a 5.88% CAP rate. What’s particularly noteworthy is that it traded
well below its asking price of $3,150,000, representing a 24% discount.
This significant price adjustment indicates a growing emphasis among
buyers on in-place income and physical condition
over speculative upside.
The reduced transaction volume likely reflects a
combination of factors, including the implementation
of stricter rent control measures in the City of Santa
Barbara, ongoing concerns about interest rates,
and a consistent bid-ask spread between seller
expectations and buyer capacity.</p>

<div id="isla-vista" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.7">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.7</span> Isla Vista</h4>
<p>Isla Vista saw two transactions in Q1 2025, reflecting
continued investor interest in the student housing
market near UCSB. At 850 Camino Pescadero, a
12-unit property traded off-market for $6,775,000
($564,583/Unit) at a 6.10% CAP rate. Notably, this
property previously sold in 2022 for $3,925,000, and
the significant price appreciation is attributed to
extensive renovations and the addition of an ADU,
bringing the property to a premium market standard.
The second transaction was at 6575 Segovia Rd., a
12-unit property that sold for $3,700,000 ($308,333/
Unit) at a 4.57% CAP rate. This property traded
7% below its asking price of $3,975,000. It required
immediate capital improvements, particularly to
the roof, but its strategic location within Isla Vista
and resulting acquisition price made it a compelling
investment opportunity.
Isla Vista continues to benefit from its unique
positioning as a student housing market, where
tenant turnover allows for more frequent rent
adjustments compared to other Central Coast
submarkets.</p>

<div id="santa-barbara-north-county-5-units" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.8">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.8</span> Santa Barbara North County | 5+ Units</h4>
<p>Santa Barbara North County showed strength in Q1 2025,
with three transactions completed, highlighting increased
demand for multifamily properties in Lompoc. The largest
transaction was at 411-415 N. H St., a 29-unit property that
sold for $4,875,000 ($168,103/Unit) at a 4.85% CAP rate.
The property traded off-market, underscoring heightened
demand for Lompoc multifamily assets. The context of
this sale suggests that growth in the area may be partly
fueled by nearby Vandenberg Village and the SpaceX
facility, bolstering the region with strong economic drivers.
Two additional transactions in Lompoc were part of a
two-property sale: 732 N. G St., a 7-unit property that
sold for $1,455,000 ($207,857/Unit) at a 5.00% CAP rate,
and 736 N. G St., a 6-unit property that sold for $800,000 ($133,333/Unit) at a 5.95% CAP rate. The combined per-unit price of
approximately $173,000 is yet another example of a “low-end” price point for multifamily product in Lompoc.
The activity in North County, particularly in Lompoc, represents a notable shift in investor sentiment. CAP rates remain more
attractive than those typically seen in South County properties, providing stronger cash flow for investors concerned about rising
operating costs and interest rates.</p>

<div id="ventura-county-5-units" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.9">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.9</span> Ventura County | 5+ Units</h4>
<p>Ventura County saw three transactions in Q1 2025. The most significant was at 850 Warwick Ave. in Thousand Oaks, a 50-unit
property that sold for $18,200,000 ($364,000/Unit) at a 4.50% CAP rate. The property previously traded in 2021 for $16.1MM,
representing a modest appreciation of approximately 13% over four years.
In the City of Ventura, 473–477 W. Ramona St., a 15-unit property, sold for $2,600,000 ($173,333/Unit) at a 4.00% CAP rate. This
property was purchased by the City of Ventura for potential affordable housing development, with strong ADU potential given its
sizable 33,105 SF lot.
The third transaction was at 47–53 W Prospect St., a 7-unit property that sold for $1,625,000 ($232,143/Unit) at a 4.54% CAP rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="san-luis-obispo-county-5-units" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.10">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.10</span> San Luis Obispo County | 5+ Units</h4>
<p>SLO County recorded two transactions in Q1 2025. In Oceano, a 20-unit property at 1470 S. 13th St. sold for $3,710,000 ($185,500/
Unit) at a 5.35% CAP rate. The property comprised a main house and three duplexes situated on a 3.5-acre lot.
The second transaction was in Atascadero at 17255 Walnut Ave., a 7-unit property that sold for $1,675,000 ($239,286/Unit), selling
to a cash buyer at 16% below asking price.
Both transactions in SLO County closed below their asking prices, reflecting the market’s adjustment to current economic
conditions. The focus on less central areas indicates that investors are seeking emerging value opportunities outside traditionally
strong markets.</p>
</div>
<div id="multifamily-summary-5-units" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.11">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.11</span> Multifamily Summary | 5+ Units</h4>
<p>The first quarter of 2025 presented a mixed picture for the Central Coast 5+ unit multifamily market. With a total of 12 transactions
across all submarkets, activity was moderate compared to the robust fourth quarter of 2024. Several key themes emerged:
Most properties traded below asking prices, with discounts ranging from 2% to 24%, further signaling the ongoing market
correction as sellers adjust to new economic realities. CAP rates have continued their upward trajectory, with most transactions in
the 4.5% to 6.0% range—a significant shift from the sub-4% CAP rates common just three years ago.
North County, particularly Lompoc, demonstrated unexpected resilience with three transactions, while traditionally strong markets
like South County saw reduced activity. Buyers across all submarkets continue to emphasize current performance over speculative
upside, with turn-key assets commanding premium pricing.
Larger institutional investors remain active in the market, as evidenced by the 50-unit Thousand Oaks transaction and the 29-unit
oceanfront property in Santa Barbara. The student housing market near UCSB continues to perform well, with two significant
transactions demonstrating the appeal of consistently occupied properties with regular tenant turnover.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2025, we anticipate transaction activity will gradually increase as more sellers align their pricing
expectations with current market conditions. The recent Federal Reserve signals about potential rate cuts later in 2025 may
provide some relief, though timing remains uncertain.
The fundamentals of the Central Coast multifamily market remain strong, with vacancy rates holding steady at historically low
levels of 2-3% in South County and 3-4% in North County and SLO County. Rental rate growth has moderated to around 2-3%
annually, down from the peaks seen in 2021–2022 but still outperforming national averages.
For investors, the emphasis on current performance and conservative underwriting is likely to continue throughout 2025. Turn-
key properties are experiencing softer demand and are trading at higher CAP rates in the current market environment. Properties
offering stable income, limited deferred maintenance, and potential for modest rent growth will continue to attract the most buyer
interest, though buyers remain disciplined in valuations relative to previous market cycles.</p>
</div>
<div id="santa-barbara-24-units" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.12">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.12</span> Santa Barbara | 2–4 Units</h4>
<p>The first quarter of 2025 recorded 8 closed transactions in the 2–4 unit multifamily residential segment within the City of
Santa Barbara — a notable slowdown compared to the strong finish that saw 30 sales in Q4 of 2024. While the drop in sales
activity suggests a more measured start to the year, market fundamentals indicate continued interest from both investors and
owner-users.
Despite fewer closings, 7 new listings hit the market in Q1, showing that property owners are still testing the waters. Three of
these newly listed properties went into escrow and successfully closed before the quarter ended — signaling that buyers are
actively monitoring the market and are ready to move on well-positioned deals.
At the close of Q1, there were 10 active listings available, providing a solid pipeline of opportunities heading into Q2. With an
average Days on Market (DOM) of 50.25, we’re seeing a pace that aligns with a more balanced, healthy market.
It’s also worth noting that the uncertain future surrounding rent caps and so-called “renoviction” policies currently under
discussion by the Santa Barbara City Council may be influencing seller behavior. The potential for increased restrictions
and new limitations on landlords has likely become a motivating factor for some mom-and-pop or long-time family-owned
operators to exit the market ahead of additional regulation. This policy uncertainty adds another layer of complexity to
investment decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5 Duplexes</li>
<li>2 Triplexes</li>
<li>1 Fourplex</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the 8 sales, 3 properties sold after at least one price reduction, underscoring the importance of strategic pricing in today’s
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Sales:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>424–426 E. Valerio St.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Upper East duplex set the benchmark for highest
price per unit in Q1. Originally listed at $3,495,000, the
property sold in February after a price adjustment to
$3,150,000 — equating to $1,575,000 per unit. The
property featured a beautifully maintained 4-bed,
3.5-bath craftsman main residence with a large
backyard, plus a detached 1-bed, 1-bath unit with
a private patio. Future ADU potential made this an
especially attractive offering for value-add buyers in
a premium location.</p>
<ul>
<li>410/411 W. Cota St. &amp; Dibblee St.</li>
</ul>
<p>A standout from an investment perspective, this
combined triplex and duplex package (5 units total)
was marketed as a small portfolio. Initially listed at
$2,500,000 ($500,000/unit), the property sold at
$2,350,000 ($470,000/unit), making it one of the
lowest price-per-unit sales of the quarter. Delivered
vacant, the opportunity presented flexibility for a
full remodel or possible redevelopment into higher-
density housing.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.13</span> Multifamily Summary | 2–4 Units</h4>
<p>Properties with tenant complexities, deferred maintenance, or less attractive GRMs are sitting on the market longer. However,
there remains a pool of active, motivated investors — in the $1,000,000 to $3,000,000 range. Well-located properties with clean
unit mixes and realistic asking prices are continuing to transact, often without significant concessions.
This segment continues to draw hybrid interest, with a mix of pure investors and owner-occupiers. That blend creates a unique
dynamic for duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in desirable neighborhoods, where some buyers are willing to accept lower
immediate returns in exchange for long-term appreciation and lifestyle benefits.
Heading into Q2, Santa Barbara’s 2–4 unit market appears stable but price-sensitive. Inventory is modest, demand is still present,
and underwriting remains disciplined. Expect more traction from listings priced appropriately with upside potential — especially as
buyers adjust expectations and sellers become more strategic.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.1</span> COMMERCIAL SALES: A Season of Investor Caution</h4>
<p>Commercial sales activity was sluggish in Q1, continuing (and deepening) the low-volume trend of the past two years. There were only 11 transactions along the South Coast, which is less than half the quarterly average during the prior five years. The total dollar value was $30 million, the lowest Q1 total since 2009 and 59% below the 5-year average.</p>
<p>We should note that two local shopping centers—Magnolia Center and Casitas Plaza—transitioned ownership in a $4 billion REIT acquisition. While these were unpriced transfers and excluded from sale totals, they underscore ongoing institutional interest in the area.</p>
<p>The lending environment continues to inhibit sales, as buyers confront higher interest rates, and sellers have generally resisted lowering their price expectations accordingly. In other market cities, higher interest rates have induced leveraged owners to sell when their loans come due, but so far this pressure hasn’t produced an increase in supply or “distressed” pricing locally.</p>
<p>Investor activity was more limited this quarter, with just two investment sales—a record low compared to the 5-year average of 12. Highlights included a $4.2 million acquisition the 24,600 SF office building at 5638 Hollister Ave in Goleta, and a premium-priced retail/office property at 730 Anacapa St in Santa Barbara, purchased at over $1,300 per SF.</p>
<p>By contrast, owner-user demand was a bright spot, with nine completed transactions—7% above the five-year average. The quarter’s highest-price sale was the owner-user purchase of 29 W Calle Laureles, a 7,400 SF office building off the upper De La Vina Street corridor, for $4.6 million.</p>
<p>Another positive sign: nine of the 11 sales were off-market, signaling healthy buyer demand and proactive acquisition strategies. Historically, such off-market activity correlates with confidence in underlying fundamentals, even when overall transaction volume is subdued. The sobering flip side is that only two on-market sales closed, the lowest count we have on record.</p>
<p>The lull in activity affected all property types. Office property sales represented 36% of the dollar volume, with the most substantial sales mentioned previously. There were only two industrial sales along Gutierrez Street in Santa Barbara purchased by owner-users. The lone retail sale was 5999 Hollister Ave, a high-traffic corner building in Goleta purchased for Megan’s Organic Market cannabis at the lofty price of $1,095 per SF.</p>
<p>Inventory of property for sale grew 31% during Q1, due both to below-average transaction volume and the preponderance of off-market sales. The current inventory of 68 properties for sale is the most since the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, potential buyers appear more discerning and frugal, reflecting economic uncertainty and financing constraints. Investor demand, while less evident this past quarter, is still alert to opportunities, especially well-located properties or value-add projects with substantial upside. Demand from owner-users is also shaping the market, as they have found more properties available to choose from while investors take a more cautious stance.</p>
<p>The missing element remains demand at higher price points. There were only 20 commercial sales over $5 million during 2023 and 2024 combined, and none in Q1 of 2025. Still, 15 such properties are on the market and surely more potential sellers on the sidelines, positioning the region well when momentum at higher price points returns.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.2</span> OFFICE LEASING</h4>
<p>South Coast office leasing was in low gear during Q1, with transactions and dollar value trending 32% and 52%, respectively, below 5-year averages. Yet Goleta has shown resilience, with vacancy dipping below 6%—a substantial improvement over its double-digit rate just two years ago. Meanwhile, Santa Barbara’s vacancy is 10.5% and Carpinteria’s remains near 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Barbara</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Office vacancy in Santa Barbara has been in double digits for more than two years. Setting aside the conceptual offering of the upper floors of the former Nordstrom building, the vacancy rate is 8.5%, which is still very high compared to historical levels.</li>
<li>The quarter’s largest leases were renewals: American Riviera Bank extended its 13,000 SF lease at 1033 Anacapa St, and CrossnoKaye renewed the 7,000 SF fourth floor of the Granada Tower at 1216 State St. New leases included 5,500 SF at Anacota Plaza (602 Anacapa St) by a nonprofit, and 4,300 SF at 3760 State St by Channel Wealth.</li>
<li>Small spaces continue to prevail, with two-thirds of leases under 2,000 SF. Professional office space represented most of the activity, while the only tech tenant was the renewal by CrossnoKaye.</li>
<li>The leasing activity during the quarter did not match the arrival of new vacancy, resulting in a net addition of 11,000 SF to inventory. The largest new space is 13,500 SF of professional office on the second floor of 1021 Anacapa St. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goleta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given that two years ago Goleta’s vacancy rate was over 10%, the current vacancy of 5.9% is evidence of the re-stabilization of the office market in Goleta Valley. Gross absorption was relatively modest in Q1 though, totaling 47,500 SF from 7 transactions.</li>
<li>Kollmorgen Corporation renewed 21,000 SF at 33 S La Patera Ln on a short-term basis, which was the largest Q1 deal in terms of size. Among the new leases, defense contractor Anduril Industries leased 6,600 SF at 175 Cremona Dr, and IT provider CIO solutions leased 4,500 SF at 120 Cremona Dr. </li>
<li>There are 12 spaces available over 10,000 SF, the three largest of which are for sublease: 43,600 SF at 50 Castilian Dr; 29,300 SF at 6500 Hollister Ave; and 22,700 SF at 425 Pine Ave.</li>
<li>All told, 44% of the available space is sublease space, a relatively high ratio reflecting evolving space needs in the hybrid work environment that has held sway since the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carpinteria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Carpinteria, Forgeline Solutions leased 8,500 SF of space formerly held by Procore at 6267 Carpinteria Ave. This was the lone transaction in that city during Q1.</li>
<li>Additional space totaling 70,800 SF offered for sublease by Procore continues to represent the majority of available space in Carpinteria. The Forgeline lease helped bring vacancy down slightly, but the rate is still very high at 18.1%.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="figs/hayes4.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<div id="retail-leasing" class="section level4" number="4.2.2.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.3</span> RETAIL LEASING</h4>
<p>The South Coast saw limited retail leasing activity in Q1, with transactions posting 25% below the 5-year average. However, vacancy has held steady for the past 12 months and is currently 3.1%.</p>
<p>For the downtown State Street corridor (400 to 1300 blocks), the storefront vacancy rate is 12.4%, as low as it’s been for the last five years. Most notable of the new availabilities is the Starbucks space at State and Victoria, representing another example of a national brand potentially vacating a State Street location.</p>
<p>There were five new leases on State Street. Most notably, Pascucci leased 1230-A State St, which will enable Laura Knight to continue her restaurant’s 30-plus year presence on State Street. The space she is vacating, 509 State St, was quickly claimed by Ghirardelli Chocolate &amp; Ice Cream for its 20th US location. Two leases were signed on the beleaguered 900 block by the pair of tenants who recently set up shops in Summerland’s Big Yellow House: Mevra Kamaci leased 909 State for a clothing and jewelry shop, and Arrediamo rugs will occupy 911½ State. Last but not least, the Shade Store renewed 635 State.</p>
<p>Looking at other downtown retail, two leases signed on Chapala Street were House of Brutal Power Gym at 1236 Chapala and AK Auto Repair at 1301 Chapala, across from Public Market. Newly available spaces downtown include the former Banc of California space at 16-20 W Canon Perdido St, and the former Victor the Florist building at 135 E Anapamu St. Also of note, the 33,000 SF ground floor of the former Nordstrom building (called 817 State St) is now being marketed exclusively for retail use.</p>
<p>In Montecito, Marisa Mason Jewelry secured a space at The Post on East Cabrillo Blvd. And Dr. Steven Gundry, whose nutrition ads feature on Youtube, leased the space next to Ca’ Dario at 1187 Coast Village Rd. New availabilities include 1137 and 1292 Coast Village Rd.</p>
<p>On Upper State, Mendocino Farms leased the former Panera restaurant space at 3851 State St (next to La Cumbre Plaza) with plans to open next year.</p>
<p>Goleta saw one lease renewal by Phamous Café at The Plaza Shopping Center (7127 Hollister Ave). Recent spaces to come to market are the 10,300 SF cinema space at Fairview Shopping Center, the Kyle’s Kitchen space at Hollister Village, and the Goodland BBQ restaurant building in Old Town. All three spaces are still open for business with their current tenants. Goleta vacancy remains quite low at 2.7%, and asking rents average $3.50 per SF gross.</p>
<p><img src="figs/hayes5.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<em>1230-A State St will be the new home of Pascucci, one of the longest-running local restaurant businesses in Santa Barbara</em></p>
</div>
<div id="industrial-leasing" class="section level4" number="4.2.2.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.4</span> INDUSTRIAL LEASING</h4>
<p>Industrial leasing, like office and retail, saw a dip in transactions during Q1. However, a handful of large leases booted gross absorption 48% compared to the 5-year average. Average asking rents rose 10% year-over-year to $2.36 per SF gross.
Goleta’s industrial vacancy decreased slightly in Q1, following Curvature’s lease of 26,800 SF at 839 Ward Dr, a building that Herbl remodeled five years ago. Consumer Fire Products subleased 5,832 SF at 147 Castilian Dr from Karl Storz Imaging. The vacancy rate of 3.1% indicates the healthy fundamentals of Goleta’s industrial market.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara has seen the addition of three spaces larger than 10,000 SF to the market during the past year. There were three transactions in Q1, including the renewal of 7,450 SF at 526 Laguna St by Santa Barbara Paint Depot. A new lease by Pampel Design secured 3,100 SF at 309 Palm Ave. Even with the added inventory, the vacancy rate remains exceptionally low at 1.4%.</p>
<p>Carpinteria’s market was energized by its largest lease in recent years as Mesa Energy Systems secured of 22,000 SF at 1120 Mark Ave, previously held by Bright Rentals. Gigavac brought 40,000 SF to market for sublease at 6382 Rose Ln. All told, the vacancy rate of 5.7% represents about 20% more available space than a year ago.</p>
