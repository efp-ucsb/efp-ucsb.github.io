<p>Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries continued to grow in 2023. Total Employment increased from 208,541 jobs in 2022 to 209,266 jobs in 2023. This gain of 725 workers represents an increase of 0.35%, which is lower than the previous year’s growth rate of 0.21%. Since December of 2013, Santa Barbara County has a net gain of 8,541 jobs, averaging an increase of 854 jobs each year. This is a sign that the labor markets in Santa Barbara County are healthy.</p>
<p>Nonfarm payroll in California increased in 2023, at a rate of 0.21%. Since December of 2013, nonfarm payrolls have increased in California by 8.88%. United States nonfarm payroll has also increased at a rate of 1.73%. This is significantly higher than the 2021 growth rate of 1.39%. Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll growth increased by 0.35%, which is slightly lower compared to California. This is higher than the 2021 growth rate of 0.13%. Nonfarm payroll is indexed to July 2009, and since the end of the recession, Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll gains (3.67%) have been lower than both the United States’ (15.13%) and California’s (13.56%).</p>

<p>The average number of unemployed workers and the unemployment rate has also improved in the past year. The unemployment rate dropped from a peak of 14.6% in 2021 to, based on the most recent data, 4.3% in 2023. The number unemployed, defined as workers who are without work and are actively seeking work, has increased from a peak of 7,900 in 2021, to 10,066 in 2022, and then down to 8,983 in 2023. This drop of 1,083 unemployed workers in the past year represents a decline of 13.7%. The declines in both variables have been gradually slowing down as the labor market returns to so-called “full employment”, loosely defined as the lowest possible level that will not cause inflation. If unemployment falls significantly, inflation will rise as employers compete to hire workers and push up wages too fast. The size of the labor force in Santa Barbara County has increased from 2022 to 2023 by 1,800 workers. This is a small increase of 0.83%.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> Firm Size Data<a href="employment-and-income.html#firm-size-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Since 2022, firm size distribution in Santa Barbara has remained relatively the same. In 2022, the most common number of employees at a firm in Santa Barbara is between 20-49 employees, and this has been unchanged since 2012. Even though it is still the most common number of employees, the proportion of firms with this range of employees has increased from the 2012 level of 18.1% to 18.8% in 2022. Firms with 50-99 employees saw the greatest decline in firm size distribution since 2008. In 2008, firms with 50-99 employees accounted for nearly 15% of firm size distribution, where in 2018; these firms only account 12.5% of firm size distribution.</p>
<p><img src="figs/employment_and_income/employment/firm_size_sbcali.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>In 2022, firms with 250-499 employees had the largest average payroll expenditure per employee at $18,634. Looking across all different firm sizes, we can see that payroll per employee has increased in almost all firm size categories. The largest changes in payroll per employee from 2012 to 2022 were in firms with 250-499 employees and firms with 50-99 employees. These firms saw payroll per employee increases of 43.2% and 36.6% respectively.</p>
<p>In Santa Barbara County, 39.8% of employees work for firms that employ over 100 workers. This is 5.5 percentage points less than California, where 45.3% of employees work for firms with over 100 workers. These numbers have converged in recent years. We can also see that in Santa Barbara County most Retail Trade Services employees work for firms with 100-249 employees, while most Agriculture employees work for larger firms.</p>
<p><img src="figs/employment_and_income/employment/payroll_firm_size.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Santa Barbara County’s firm size distribution difference between California’s is the proportion of workers in small businesses. For California, 54.7% of employees work in firms with less than 100 employees. The distribution is much larger in Santa Barbara County, where 60.2% of employees work in firms with less than 100 employees. Besides the difference in employee distribution in firms with less than 100 workers, Santa Barbara County and California’s firm size distribution are similar. The only major difference is in firms with 1000+ employees, as 15.6% of California employees work in firms of the largest size. Only 8.8% of Santa Barbara employees work in firms with 1000+ workers, although this number is significantly larger than it has been in recent years.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nonfarm Payrolls are expected to grow at a rate of 0.87% in the upcoming year, an increase of 1,915 jobs. While this growth rate is high by historical standards, it is lower than the 0.94% growth observed in 2022.</li>
<li>Our statistical forecast suggests a 2023 December unemployment rate of 4.7%, an increase of 0.57 percentage points compared with December 2022. The 95% confidence interval spans from a low of 0.84% to a high of 8.56%.</li>

<p>The forecasting methods used in this section are based on the Census Bureau’s X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Their program can be used to forecast a series using only its statistical features. Each employment series has a seasonal component (the December effect for retail trade is one example), a trend component (like the long-run downward trend in goods-producing industries or a multi-year recession), and an irregular component (a one-month bump or decline in the series for reasons that will not occur again, like the 2012 Olympics producing a one-month bump in the London economy). After decomposing a time-series into these three components, the current trend component and seasonal component can be used to forecast the series. While the irregular series cannot be predicted, since it has an expected value of zero, and systematic changes to the trend and seasonal components also cannot be predicted, the history of how these components have varied in the past can be used to generate confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Each figure in this section shows the recent unadjusted and seasonally adjusted series followed by a three-year forecast. This forecast describes the most likely values for the unadjusted series. The dashed lines surrounding the forecast describe the 95% confidence interval. There is a 5% chance that values will occur outside of these dashed lines. Unless otherwise noted, each of the following year-over-year projections that we describe in the text will be between 2023 and 2024 for the unadjusted series.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Occupations<a href="employment-and-income.html#occupations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The largest occupation in Santa Barbara County is Food Preparation and Serving-Related Occupations with 21,830 workers. Between 2022 and 2023, this occupation increased by 1,020 jobs. This occupation is one of the lower-paying jobs among the top ten largest occupations in the county, with a mean annual wage of $38,704.05. The lowest-paying occupation among the top ten largest occupations is Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse, with a mean annual wage of $36,243.90. Only two of the top ten largest occupations, Management Occupations, Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations, have a mean annual wage above $100,000. Computer and Information Research Scientists, which was not among the top ten largest occupations in 2019, has the next highest mean annual salary of $369,174.24 in quarter 1 of 2023.</p>
<p><img src="figs/employment_and_income/occupations/wages_large_occupations.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Within the county, the vast majority of jobs only require high school or less with minimal training (263,550). This group comprises 65.88% of the jobs in the county that have reported education and training requirements. The second largest education group is bachelor’s degree with no experience (21,290). Only 15.76% of jobs in the county require a bachelor’s degree or more. Recent employment projections, described in the 2022 Economic Forecast Project book, suggest that this employment composition will remain constant over the next 11 years, with the vast majority of new jobs having minimal educational and training requirements.</p>
<p>Among education groups, the jobs requiring a highest mean annual wage education group have the highest median annual wage at $177,160.31, closely followed by jobs requiring a Bachelor’s degree with some work experience ($108,816.01). For the most part, education &amp; training groups with more requirements pay more, except for postsecondary non-degree award jobs. High school or less with minimal training jobs pay the lowest median annual wages ($43,105.91). This is 86.32% less than the second lowest education &amp; training group, high school or less with moderate training, and 39.61% less than the median annual wage for a bachelor’s degree with no experience.</p>

<p>In addition to providing data for individual occupations, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) also aggregates occupations into 22 occupation groups. A summary of the data for these occupation groups is provided in the following pages. Food Preparation and Serving-Related Occupations is the largest occupation group, with 21,830 jobs, and Office and Administrative Support Occupations is the second largest group, with 21,290 jobs. Office and Administrative Support Occupations saw a significant 12.75% employment increase in 2022. The occupation group that saw the largest increase in employment is Medical Transcriptionists. This group saw employment increase by an impressive 6,690 jobs, which is a 12.75% increase from 2022. This is likely the result of this sector rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual wages for the majority of occupations increased in 2022, with the exception of four occupation groups. Obstetricians and Gynecologists had the largest wage increase of 1.53%. There was also strong growth in mean annual wage among Legal Occupations and Protective Service Occupations, each of which saw a gain of 12.9%.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real per capita income in Santa Barbara County declined in 2023 at -8.03%.</li>
<li>A -6.53% growth rate of California’s real per capita income in 2023 resulted in a per capita income of $79,835, which is slightly lower than Santa Barbara’s real per capita income of $78,471.</li>
</ul>
<p>Santa Barbara County’s real per capita income changed in 2023, from 85,327 to 78,471. The real per capita income growth rate in 2019 was 6.9%, which is higher than the previous year’s growth of 5.9% (The BEA has adjusted its calculations of previous years’ per capita income since our last publication). The rate of growth in Santa Barbara was above California’s growth for 2021, -6.53%, but below that of the United States, -5.08%. US, California, and Santa Barbara County real per capita growth all declined in 2023.</p>

<p>Per capita net earnings make up the majority of per capita personal income in the United States, California, and Santa Barbara. Per capita net earnings describe wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions to pensions and insurance funds), and proprietors’ income less contributions for government social insurance and an adjustment to convert earnings from place of work to place of residence. In California and the United States, this component represents about 64.36% and 61.93% of per capita income respectively. However, in Santa Barbara, this component only represents 56.53% of per capita income.</p>

<p>The second largest factor in per capita income is formed by dividends, interest, and rent. Dividends, Interest, and rent made up 29.25% of Santa Barbara’s per capita income, 19.57% of California’s, and 19.73% in the United States in 2021. This difference can be attributed to Santa Barbara County’s unusually high income distribution; wealthier people typically earn a higher proportion of their income from investments, which produce dividends, interest, and rents, than lower-income people.</p>
<p>Hourly wages in Santa Barbara grew nominally by 4.32% in 2023, from $31.03 to $32.37. Real wages for workers in Computer and Mathematical Occupations and Legal Occupations grew the fastest over the past year, with growth rates of 15.43% and 15.43% respectively. Within the county, Production Occupations experienced the largest real hourly wage decline from 2022 to 2023, losing 15.43%. Pharmacists continue to have the highest real wages in 2023 at $76.09 per hour compared to the average across all occupations of $32.37.</p>
