<p>Formerly known and beloved as the Fess Parker, A Doubletree by Hilton, a AAA
Four Diamond beach resort, the Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront was unveiled in
May 2018. In partnership with Hilton Hotels Corporation and the Fess Parker
Family, the resort has been providing the best of Santa Barbara hospitality to
both locals and visitors for 28 years.</p>
<p>Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort combines warm and welcoming service to
our out-of-town visitors who come to our city for both business and pleasure.
This family-friendly and pet-friendly resort offers 360 guest rooms and suites
on 24 ocean-facing acres. We are a favorite of repeat visitors because of the
variety of amenities offered. As a member of the Hilton Family of Brands,
Hilton HHonors Members receive also Points and Miles for each qualifying stay.</p>
<p>For locals as well out out-of-town guests, the conference facilities at the
resort are the largest in town and offer unique venues such as the 20,000
square foot Plaza Del Sol. The property was built on the site of the former
Southern Pacific Railroad Roundhouse, and the Plaza architecture reflects the
history of the location. A number of expansive ballrooms, ocean view meeting
rooms, and executive boardrooms total over 45,000 square feet of meeting space
for weddings, fundraising dinners, business conferences, and trade shows.</p>
<p>A member of the Green Lodging Program of America, Hilton Santa Barbara
Beachfront Resort is committed to sustainable and environmentally healthy
practices. From the all-natural beef and sustainably-farmed seafood served in
our restaurants and banquets, to an expansive recycling and composting program,
to environmentally-friendly landscaping and HVAC practices, the resort helps
keep Santa Barbara the beautiful and natural place we all love.</p>
<p>As a local business and a local neighbor, Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront
Resort invites you to relax and enjoy a glass of Fess Parker wine by the fire
on the ocean front patio, or savor a meal featuring farm-to-fork produce and
natural beef, or come participate in one of the many community events hosted
by a local non-profit in our Grand Ballroom. We are confident that our
commitment to hospitality will welcome both guests and locals in true Santa
Barbara style.</p>

results of this vision are many and include a hard working, high quality and
fiscally sound organization with objective goals and measurable achievements.
Since 1969, the Housing Authority has developed and/or secured over 4,000 units
of affordable rental housing for Santa Barbara through a variety of programs,
including workforce housing, public housing, congregate living facilities for
frail seniors, supportive housing for the homeless as well as the Section 8
Housing Choice Voucher program. Through Section 8 alone, the Housing Authority
infuses over $32 million per year in federal tax revenue to the South Coast
economy. The Authority’s dedicated Board of Commissioners and staff ensure that
HACSB continues to be a well-managed, compassionate and effective affordable
housing and service provider.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Housing Authority of the City of Santa Barbara formed an affiliate
non-profit, 2nd Story Associates out of the recognition of a growing unmet need
for sufficient affordable housing and expanded resident service programs for
low-Income families, seniors and disabled individuals in Santa Barbara. 2nd
Story’s programs promote a holistic service approach to low income households
by promoting educational opportunities for children, economic advancement for
adults and overall self-sufficiency programs for entire families. 2nd Story has
also become instrumental in the funding and development of new affordable
housing. As an affiliate non-profit, they have helped the Housing Authority
access certain forms of financing that is not always available to public
agencies.</p>

<p>The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara is founded on the belief
that decent, safe and sanitary housing is central to the physical and emotional
health, productivity, and self-esteem of the people it serves. Our mission is
primarily to build, acquire, own, manage and maintain residential rental units
for persons of extremely low, very low and low-income and to obtain rent
payment assistance for similar households renting in the private market.
Operating through a central Administrative Office in Lompoc and Housing
Management and Maintenance offices in Goleta, Lompoc and Santa Maria, the
Authority provides direct services to applicants, tenants and private property
owners. In 2018, the Executive Director and staff will implement a combined
agency-wide budget of approximately $50 million while serving 4,800 extremely
low, very low and low-income households. Of the 4,800 households served, 3,400
are assisted in privately owned rentals through the federal Section 8 Housing
Choice Voucher program, operated locally since 1975. The Authority also owns,
manages and maintains 1,324 residential rental units throughout Santa Barbara
County. The Housing Authority, since its creation in 1941, has undertaken new
construction and acquisition development activities in the incorporated and
unincorporated areas of the county. We partner with seven cities and the County
of Santa Barbara to perform a variety of housing-related services in support of
local plans.</p>

<p>Harold and Betty Hutton, entrepreneurs, adventurers and business partners,
began their business as a small refining operation in Long Beach in the early
1950s and by the middle of the 70’s became a leading exporter of oil and
natural gas from South East Asia.</p>
<p>In 1975, while living and working in Indonesia, Harold Hutton passed away
suddenly. After his death, Betty decided to close the company’s oil operation
in South East Asia and return to her roots in Orange, California. It was there,
following a short retirement, that she established Hutton Companies, a
commercial real estate development corporation.</p>
<p>In 1984, Betty Hutton asked Tom Parker to assume a management role at Hutton
Companies.  Together, Tom and Betty worked to grow and stabilize Hutton
Companies as well as to fund and activate the Foundation.</p>
<p>Betty Hutton passed away unexpectedly in September of 1995.  Since then, Hutton
Parker Foundation has maintained its mission of striving to make a difference
in the communities it serves through funding programs that support nonprofit
sustainability and longevity.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation has grown into one of the largest private family
foundations located in Santa Barbara County.  The Foundation owns and operates
many commercial properties providing office space to more than 60 local area
nonprofits agencies.  In addition, Hutton Parker Foundation awards nearly $4
million in grants, donations and discounted rent to approximately 300 nonprofit
organizations annually.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include:  Arts &amp; Culture, Education, Health &amp; Human Services,
Children, Youth &amp; Families, and Civic &amp; Community.  Funding programs include:
Core Operating Support, Marketing &amp; Media Grants, Endowment and Capital
Support.</p>
<p>Hutton Parker Foundation strives to provide organizational sustainability to
community-based nonprofit organizations throughout Santa Barbara County and to
assist agencies in achieving their highest level of performance and delivery of
services resulting in stronger, more efficient communities for all.</p>

<p>The Association’s programs include awards that honor academic and career
achievement and university service, a quarterly magazine, a summer family

<p>Every year, thousands of alumni from every walk of life (and from around the
globe) give something back to UC Santa Barbara by mentoring current students,
participating in the annual All Gaucho Reunion, making financial donations,
serving on alumni committees, or becoming active in regional alumni events.</p>
<p>Mosher Alumni House, called the “cornerstone of the campus,” provides a

<p>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. – On March 17, 2000, Pacific Coast Business Times was

<p>For over six decades, The Towbes Group (“TG”) has been committed to the growth
and prosperity of the Central Coast. Focused on meeting the needs of the
communities it serves, TG has grown to become one of the premier real estate
services companies on the Central Coast. Based in Santa Barbara, TG couples an
entrepreneurial spirit and strong technical expertise to identify, design,
build and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate assets from Westlake
Village to Santa Maria. Today, the company manages a portfolio of more than
2,800 multifamily residential units and 1.1 million square feet in commercial,
industrial, and retail space. Throughout its history, TG has consistently
operated with the view that integrity, reliability, loyalty, providing real
value and most notable, superior customer service must always be an integral
part of everything we do. At TG we believe that the “building blocks” of a
strong community start with an unwavering commitment to “Creating Places where
People Thrive.”</p>
<p>Today, in addition to third party property management services, TG offers third
party development, project management and construction services. While quietly
building dreams for other property owners, TG has successfully completed a
number of marquee projects throughout Santa Barbara County, including the
Sansum Clinic Foothill Medical &amp; Surgical Center and Eye Center buildings,
Sumida Gardens Apartments in Goleta, and the Charles Munger Residence (formally
known as the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics Visiting Scholars
Residence) at UCSB.</p>
<p>Beyond its success as a full-service real estate services company, more than
125 TG employees call the Central Coast their home and are dedicated to the
principles on which the company was founded. Community involvement is central
to the company culture and is demonstrated through volunteerism and local
events. Through their Give Where You Live, TG donates $25 from every move-in to
local nonprofits, raising about $30,000 annually. From 2016-2019, TG founded
and sponsored Give-A-Palooza, which brought together eight large local
companies to compete in a series of sports with Special Olympics athletes. In
four years, Give-A-Palooza raised $100,000 for Special Olympics of Southern
California and inspired a stronger sense of community among corporate
colleagues. In 2019, as part of the company’s commitment to #OutHelping, TG
closed its doors for the entire day to ensure the TG employee family could
participate in an important community-wide day of volunteering. TG’s effort
for #OutHelping focused on restoring Camp Whittier for the United Boys &amp; Girls
Clubs of Santa Barbara County.</p>

what are the anticipated growth plans; and what are the company’s specific
challenges, needs, and pain points. Then, we provide information on what we
have to offer and explain how our technology solutions can address the business
needs. By adhering to this approach, we believe that our clients benefit from a
loyal, long-term partner who works with you instead of just for you.</p>

</center>
<p>If you ask our customers to reflect on their relationship with Walpole, two
messages come through again and again. First, they trust and appreciate our
sound judgment and advice. Second, they acknowledge the importance of our
working partnership. As one of our customers put it, “Your advice is valuable,
innovative, creative, but realistic. You are more than an accountant, you’re a
mentor as well.”</p>
<p>Clients often mention the friendly, caring attitude we bring to our very
personal associations with them—a welcome respite from the unforgiving world of
budgets, audits and government regulations. A client who’s been with us since
our beginning had this to say, “For over 30 years, Walpole has been more than
an accounting firm. They have been a friend who cared about our business.”</p>
<p>We know our customers expect much more from us today than they did when we
opened our doors back in 1974. Traditional accounting functions—tax
preparation, payroll, audits, bookkeeping and financial statements—only scratch
the surface of Walpole’s current capabilities.</p>
<p>In order to adequately protect your financial position today and build a
feasible plan for your fiscal future, Walpole employs a diverse team of
specialists with complementary strengths. They’re well-trained experts who know
how and when to employ the latest information and innovative technologies to
achieve financial success. A local business controller confirmed this when he
said, “Walpole has a reputation for being able to employ different and workable
systems for a variety of businesses and projects.”</p>

<p>MarBorg Industries is a local, family-owned and operated business which has
been serving the County of Santa Barbara for over 80 years. The business which
was started out of necessity by Mario F Borgatello and his brother Charles
Borgatello has evolved over time from a two man operation to over 350
employees.</p>
<p>In 1911 Segundo and Josephine Borgatello immigrated to Santa Barbara,
Californian from Asti, Italy. Within months of Segundo’s youngest child’s
birth he passed away leaving Josephine to care for 5 very young children. She
did what she could to support her family by working as a seamstress and taking
in other immigrant workers from Italy into her home. The family struggled for
many years and at very young ages the children did whatever jobs they could to
help their mother survive financially. In the late 1930’s, Mario F Borgatello
started a small business in the rural hills of Montecito, California.
Together with his brother Charles they would walk great distances from house to
house to collect food waste to feed the hogs that their mother was raising.
Soon many of their customers asked them to start taking away all their trash
items and hence a family business was started out of others people trash.</p>
<p>In endeavoring to grow the seeds of recycling and preservation that were
planted by Mario and Charles in the 1930’s, MarBorg has continued to be on the
forefront of recycling technology. Through continued investment and innovation
MarBorg has steadily increased the amount of material that they are able to
process and recycle to 200,000 tons per year. Because of this continued effort
and investment, MarBorg has become the largest private source of recycling for
the Cities of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Buellton, UCSB and the County of Santa

system in 1944 and has since grown to be an integral and important part of
public postsecondary education in the state.</p>
<p>The UCSB campus occupies a 1,055-acre site at the edge of the Pacific Ocean.
UCSB enrolls more than 23,000 students, with almost 2,800 at the graduate
level. Competition for admission is keen. In recent years the campus has
enrolled the most academically competitive and ethnically diverse classes in
its history. More than 200 majors, degrees, and credentials are offered through
UCSB’s five schools and the Graduate Division. The university also has two
professional schools: the Donald Bren School of Environmental Science and
Management, and the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education.</p>
<p>The preeminent scholarship, instruction, and public service that define UCSB
have helped shape its identity as a place of enormous and exceptional
possibility—a magnet for innovation.</p>
<p>Pioneering research is a critical component of the highest quality education.
UCSB’s 1,100-member faculty includes five Nobel Prize winners for landmark
research in chemistry, physics, and economics and scores of elected members of
national and international academies and societies as well as dozens of winners
of Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellowships. An alumna of the College of Creative
Studies was named 2009 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine. The campus is
one of only 61 research-intensive institutions elected to membership in the
prestigious Association of American Universities.</p>

<p>Established in 1973, the UC Santa Barbara Foundation is a non-profit,
public-benefit corporation organized to raise, accept, and administer private
gifts and grants to UC Santa Barbara. By joining forces with the professional,
business, and academic worlds, the Foundation serves in a leadership role to
increase private support for University programs. It generates moneys for
those areas of need at UC Santa Barbara that cannot be met by state funds.</p>
<p>As UC Santa Barbara has continued to grow in academic prominence, the
Foundation’s role has become more critical in encouraging private gifts to
supplement the University’s traditional sources of funding.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Barbara Foundation is pleased to serve as a sponsor of the UCSB
Economic Forecast Project. The EFP is an exemplar for community service
programs that benefit both the private, public and non-profit sectors of our
local economy through the development of comprehensive economic data and
unbiased analysis of that data.</p>

<br />
</center>
<p>The business-friendly, award-winning, “All America City” of Santa Maria is home
to many companies and more than 108,000 residents who enjoy this slice of
California’s beautiful Central Coast. Businesses in need of more space, a ready
workforce, numerous customers, a moderate cost of living, and state-of-the-art
technology find it all in Santa Maria. The community is known for its can-do
spirit of cooperation. The City government provides many programs and services,
and also is proactive and accessible.</p>
<p>Santa Maria has a diverse economy based on a healthy combination of commercial
and manufacturing development, agriculture, education, health care, retail
trade, tourism, oil production, the local public airport, and nearby Vandenberg
Air Force Base. Agriculture remains a major industry with many sophisticated
infrastructure expansions such as advanced hydroponic greenhouses and large
produce coolers.</p>
<p>Santa Marians and shoppers across the region are embracing the new Enos Ranch
center with a Costco, Lowe’s, Dick’s, and many more retailers and restaurants.
Toyota and Honda are building new dealerships there. Nearby, a new public
elementary school is taking shape, and so are hundreds of new apartments. The
new $25 million corporate headquarters of CoastHills Credit Union is along
Highway 101 and Betteravia Road. Inside this new building, A.T. Still
University of Health Sciences is preparing to open with up to 100 medical
students. They will undergo an approximately two-year program en route to
becoming physicians assistants. The nonprofit university has long-term plans to
expand in Santa Maria. Elsewhere, new hotels and businesses are taking shape.
The City has the Town Center West and Town Center East (the mall), and is
implementing improvements to its downtown.</p>
<p>Economic development efforts are emphasizing the City-owned fiber optics
infrastructure and the availability of carrier-grade high-speed internet
services. Businesses also are encouraged to use the City’s state-of-the-art
regional data center, securely housed within its modern Police headquarters
building.</p>
<p>New and existing employers are assisted by the City, the Santa Maria Valley
Chamber of Commerce, and the Santa Maria Public Airport. We invite you to learn
more online at the City’s website, www.cityofsantamaria.org, at the Chamber’s
website, www.santamaria.com. Explore the area’s value for vacations and leisure
pursuits at <a href="https://santamariavalley.com" class="uri">https://santamariavalley.com</a>, and discover more services and

protection, street maintenance, public transportation, recreation, parks,
library, water, wastewater, refuse and recycling services, planning, building,
safety services - and more. The City government is one of the community’s top
employers.</p>
<p>The 2018 voter-approved Measure U sales tax extension is maintaining and
enhancing City service levels. Santa Maria is hiring more police officers and
firefighters to boost public safety, and improve youth services and the
community’s quality of life.</p>
<p>The City is investing in new technologies for its departments. Using its 700
megahertz frequency radio system, coupled with its geographic location between
San Francisco and Los Angeles, Santa Maria is better able to help other Central
Coast-based agencies upgrade their radio and public communications systems.</p>
<p>Each year Santa Maria hosts the famous Elks Rodeo and Parade, welcomes
thousands of people to the Santa Barbara County Fair, as well as entertains
families at summer concerts in the park and the family-friendly Downtown
Fridays held March through September. People enjoy the world famous Santa Maria
style tri-tip barbecues, the renowned PCPA Theater, succulent strawberries and
world-class wine country.</p>
<p>The City is recognized with national, state, and local awards. Santa Maria was
named as an “All-America City” in 1998 by one of the nation’s oldest and most
respected community recognition programs. The designation honors the way people
care for their community and take responsibility for their future, recognizing
partnerships and progress, creativity, and collaboration, perseverance, and
pride. The City has earned five prestigious statewide recognition awards for
innovative programs to improve the quality of life in the most effective manner
possible; and other awards for its leadership and collaborative spirit in
long-range water issues, law enforcement assistance, and other municipal
operations.</p>
