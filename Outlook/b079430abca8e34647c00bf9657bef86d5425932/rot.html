<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> COVID-19</h1>
<p>COVID-19 has been an unprecedented event in US (and world) history. Given the
ongoing nature of this worldwide pandemic, what we include below is certainly
not final. Instead, we hope to highlight some of the impacts of COVID-19 to
promote community discussion about how to best move forward.</p>
<div id="demographics" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Demographics</h2>
<p>While we can not yet be sure of the long term effects of COVID-19, two things
are clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals with comorbidities are most at risk</li>
<li>Social distancing works.</li>
</ul>
<p>The corollary to these two facts is that the elderly who tend to have weaker
immune systems or existing medical conditions and those who cannot effectively
social distance are particularly at risk. Related to these concerns is the fact
that low income individuals are also those most likely to have experienced
economic insecurity as a result of weakening labor markets during the pandemic.
Moreover, similar to the elderly, those of low socioeconomic status are more
likely to experience comorbidities and have higher mortality rates. But how old
exactly are Santa Barbara County residents? How many individuals cannot
effectively socially distance? Where do our most vulnerable live?</p>
<p>The age distribution of Santa Barbara County is shown in the table below.
Evidently, the age mix of Santa Barbara County residents has remained largely
unchanged over the past 5 years. The estimated median age of individuals in the
county is approximately 34 years of age, roughly 4 years below that of the
United States as a whole. Despite this fact, a substantial fraction of the
Santa Barbara County population is at elevated risk during the pandemic as a
result of old age. In fact, those aged 65+ make up 15.6% of our population.
According to the Center for Disease Control, estimates that approximately 8 out
of 10 COVID-19 deaths reported in the United States have come from this
population.</p>
<p><img src="figs/dem_detail_2020-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The population density, and in particular the number of persons per household,
is also key to understanding how any disease outbreak is likely to affect our
communities. Even with strict adherence to guidelines aimed at controlling the
spread of disease, e.g. social distancing, it is difficult for some in our
community to adhere to such recommendations. A potential consequence of a high
number of persons per household is that diseases have a greater potential to
spread as result of weekly shopping trips, going to work, etc.</p>
<p>The graph below displays the distribution of household size for both North and
South County While both regions of Santa Barbara County have a high number of
one and two person households, North County has substantially more high-density
households than does South County. In fact, households containing more than
four persons make up 22% of households in North County whereas they make up
only 11.6% of households in South County. Of particular note is the relatively
high number of 7+ person households in North County.</p>
<p><img src="figs/CombinedHHSizeDist.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>While the poorest among us are more likely to live in high density housing
environments, the Office of Disease and Health Promotion consistently finds
that those of low socioeconomic status tend to experience higher rates of heart
disease and diabetes, have higher rates of disability, and maintain higher
mortality rates. Identifying those in our community that suffer from these
comorbidities is of first order importance when managing the health risk of
disease outbreaks. The graph below shows the distribution of household income
in North and South County. It also displays in red the income groups for which
all members are below the federal poverty line for a household consisting of
four individuals. As of January 15, 2020, the federal poverty line in use by
the Department of Health and Human Services for such households is $26,200.
This cutoff represents an underestimate of those who are financially
constrained in high cost of living areas. Both regions have roughly the same
number of impoverished households as defined here. Evidently, however, North
County has significantly fewer high income households relative to South County,
with a much larger drop off following the modal income group of
$50,000-$75,000.</p>
<p><img src="figs/CombinedIncomeDist.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="foot-traffic" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Foot Traffic</h2>
<p>While demographic data informs who in our community are most at risk during
disease outbreaks, it does not provide the full picture of those affected. The
daily activities of people across the United States have fundamentally change
due to COVID-19, both by choice and because of local, state, and federal
policies. As a result, business have faced an unprecedented demand shock for
which many were unprepared. The effect of the pandemic on businesses has first
order consequences for individual employment and income. Moreover, to the
extent that the businesses close their doors for good, the effect of COVID-19
on the demand for goods and services will contribute to the long-run,
persistent effect of the pandemic on our community.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara City, for example, is known as a year-round tourist and has many
hotels, motels—including the original Motel 6—museums, parks, and other tourist
destinations. Beginning in March 2020, however, the number of visits per week
to such attractions saw large declines.</p>
<p><img src="figs/Santa%20Barbara_city_tourism.png" width="100%" /><img src="figs/Santa%20Barbara_county_tourism.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, nature parks saw a small spike in foot traffic immediately
following the statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19th. Presumably, this
spike reflects the fact that individuals were adjusting to the “new normal” in
addition to a desire to return to the outdoors after a week of remaining stuck
indoors. In fact, Elings Park and Shoreline Park, two of the most popular parks
in Santa Barbara, both saw spikes in foot traffic the week of March 30th when
the Zoo and local museums remained closed.</p>
<p><img src="figs/Santa%20Barbara_city_parks.png" width="100%" /><img src="figs/Santa%20Barbara_county_parks.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>In addition to beaches and parks, many tourists come to Santa Barbara County to
visit wine tasting rooms and microbreweries. Breweries, wineries, and beer,
wine, and liquor stores have all seen large declines in foot traffic. This
trend is apparent both in Santa Barbara City and the County as a whole. The
decline, however, is much sharper for the County as a whole than Santa Barbara
City.</p>

<p>The changes in locations that people are visiting can be visualized by matching
foot traffic data to census blocks. We accomplish this in the graph below. Map
areas without shading are census blocks with no registered points of interest
or with zero visitors in either the month of February or March. Apparently,
some outdoor areas actually experienced increases in the number of visitors in
march. More Mesa, San Miguel Open Space, and residential areas on the Mesa saw
some of the largest increases in foot traffic. Isla Vista, State Street, local
schools, colleges, and universities, and the funk zone saw dramatic declines.
This broad trend is likely true throughout most cities in Santa Barbara County:
retail, dinning, and largely student occupied areas have received very few
visitors while outdoor parks and trails have seen a rise in the number of
visitors.</p>
<p>[Insert png version of interactive foot traffic map]</p>
<p>In fact, foot traffic in dining services fell be roughly 75% County wide
leading up to the statewide shelter-in-place order. Such establishments have
continued to see a decline in visitors thereafter. Take out and fast food
services experienced similar declines.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, food and health supplement stores saw an increase in foot
traffic in early March, with GNC accounting for a large portion of that
increase. Following shelter-in-place orders, however, even these business
experienced a decline in foot traffic. Movie theaters on the other hand
experience a decline in foot traffic even before closures due to
shelter-in-place orders.</p>
<p><img src="figs/Santa%20Barbara_county_stores.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Several other establishments also experienced spikes in foot traffic at the
start of the crises. Costco, Whole Foods, and other major grocery outlets
experienced large increases leading up to the shelter-in-place orders. This
data likely reflects the fact that many individuals sought so “stock up” on
food and essentials upon learning of the seriousness of the pandemic.
Similarly, Home Depot saw a spike in foot traffic the week following the
statewide shelter-in-place order. While we cannot be sure, this is likely
indicative of the fact that individuals began tackling outstanding “at home”
projects now that they were spending substantially more time inside.</p>

<div id="unemployment-and-employment-projections" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Unemployment and Employment Projections</h2>
<p>Some of the economic effects suggested by the foot traffic data above have
already borne out in other data sources. Of concern are the effects of COVID-19
on employment in the US. Predictions of the future unemployment rate have
ranged widely in different reports. The unemployment rate had previously
reached a half century low of 3.5%. However, early on during the pandemic, some
economists predicted that it could reach above 15%. Taking a more dire outlook,
the St. Louis Federal Reserve bank suggested this slowdown could cost 47
million jobs leading to a jobless rate around 32%. What do these numbers mean
for Santa Barbara, and what do they mean for the Tricounty area more generally?</p>
<p>A striking piece of data that illuminates the harmful effects on the local
economy is the number of initial unemployment insurance claims filed in the
past few months. Below are the most recent 5 weeks of initial claims along with
the level of continued claims for California:</p>
<p><img src="figs/weekly_initial_claims.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><img src="figs/continued_claims.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>EFP has constructed its own estimates of projected job losses for California,
Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County. The different
aggregate projections by the Economic Policy Institute and St. Louis Fed
underpin the predictions.</p>
<p>First, two separate scenarios are used: the “Private share” and “Leisure,
Hospitality, and Retail share” approaches. The former assumes that all the
projected job losses are uniformly distributed across industries. The second
approach assumes that all job losses are concentrated in the Leisure,
Hospitality, and Retail sectors. However, the true levels of future
unemployment likely lie somewhere in the middle. As such, both models are
weighted equally so the results serve as a reasonably conservative estimate of
projected job losses. Quantity results are largely inelastic to changes in the
weight scheme.</p>
<p>Finally, the raw losses are translated into unemployment rate figures for Santa
Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Using numbers from the
reference month, we calculate the effect on the unemployment rate if 0 to
50,000 additional jobs are lost. Technically this assumes that all lost jobs
are by those who live in-county, but this assumption is likely unimportant
quantitatively. In the graph below we see that as more individuals lose jobs,
the higher is the associated unemployment rate. At 0 job losses–where each
line crosses the y-axis–we recover the reference month’s unemployment rate
(i.e. the rate we have most recently observed). The differences in the slopes
of each line reflect differences in the base population. For example, a loss of
50,000 jobs in Ventura would indeed be painful, but would be devastating to San
Luis Obispo county. The dotted lines indicate where our numbers above fall into
this graph. The baseline (not seasonally adjusted) employment level for the
various regions and sectors are also reported for reference.</p>
<p>The following prediction makes use of aggregate projections by the Economic
Policy Insitute which predict a private sector contraction of 19.8 million jobs
by the summer. EPI disaggregates this national figure by state; EFP follows a
similar procedure to uncover county-level numbers.</p>

<div id="individual-and-statewide-debt" class="section level2" number="3.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Individual and Statewide Debt</h2>
<p>One of the lesser recognized channels through which COVID-19, and disease
outbreaks more broadly, affect members of our community is through
individual and collective debt obligations. With unemployment at record highs,
it will be difficult for many individuals to pay their debt obligations.
Moreover, because many businesses are struggling, it is not clear that
unemployment will decrease sharply as our economy slowly reopens. As a result
of the unprecedented financial strain on both individuals and businesses, the
risk of systemic default has risen. Furthermore, the lower employment levels,
depressed incomes, and fewer operating businesses will also result in decreased
tax revenue for local, state, and federal governments. Combined with already
high levels of public debt and new economic stimulus, it will be challenging
for governments to balance budgets. As a result, it is likely that at least
some of the economic burden of this crises will be passed on to future
generations and an indirect effect of COVID-19 that is likely to persist for
many years. But just how substantial were debt obligations leading up to the
pandemic?</p>
<p>The graph below shows total federal government debt Prior to the pandemic,
federal debt quadrupled since 2000. Reaching over $20 trillion dollars.</p>
<p><img src="figs/FederalDebt-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>It is possible to break down debt both to a more local level and by type of
debt. Much of readily available data is limited to the State level. The graph
below shows revolving debt, which primarily consists of credit card debt, for
both the California and the United States as a whole. The average amount of
revolving debt held by individuals in the U.S. and California peaked during the
Great Recession an subsequently fell sharply. Since 2013, it has steadily
risen. As of 2019, revolving debt in California reached $3,810 per person
while that in the United States reached $3,390 per person.</p>
<p><img src="figs/RevolvingDebtUS_vs_CA-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>One of the largest categories of debt held by individuals is mortgage debt.
Outstanding mortgage debt per capita has become a key statistic in assessing
the risk of systemic default following the Great Recession, particularly when
labor markets are weak or individual incomes are depressed. As for revolving
debt, mortgage debt per capita peaked in 2008 and subsequently fell. In 2019,
mortgage debt per capita in California and the United States rose to $57,170
and $34,790, respectively. Still, both remain below their respective peaks of
$70,100 and $38,490.</p>
<p><img src="figs/MortgageDebtUS_vs_CA-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>A key concern for many college educated individuals is their sometimes high
levels of student loan debt. This is particularly true of both current and
recent graduates who payed for higher education through loans with the
expectation that they would enter a robust labor market. The graph below shows
that student loans among the population have risen sharply over the past 15
years, increasing by more than a factor of 5. In 2019, student loan debt per
capita in both California and the United States reached peaks of $4,640 and
$5,510, respectively. These high levels of student loan debt directly effect
the spending behavior of individuals, particularly when they are financially
constrained due to lack of employment.</p>
<p><img src="figs/StudentLoanDebtUS_vs_CA-crop.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>From the perspective of state and local governments, one of the key challenges
to balancing budgets is the need to fund pension systems. Three of the largest
pension funds that affect our local community are calPERS, calTeachers, and
UCRP. The graph below displays reported total pension liabilities and the
percent of liabilities that are unfunded. Because only a small fraction of
calPERS is required to follow all reporting guidelines necessary for our
analysis, the calPERS data represents only a part of the full calPERS pension
fund. Still, we view this data as qualitatively indicative of the program as a
whole. The reported total pension liabilities by of each pension fund Is $139
billion, $329 billion, and $88 billion, respectively. Each of these funds
reports an unfunded ratio, i.e. fraction of liabilities for which there are
insufficient fund assets, of 28%, 27%, and 21%, respectively.</p>
<p><img src="figs/_PensionFunding1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The liabilities data reported by pension funds, including those graphed above,
while informative are misleading. In particular, annual financial reports
produced by pension funds follow what are known as the GASB 67 guidelines. A
crucial assumption necessary to calculate total pension liabilities is the
assumed return of fund assets. The higher the assumed rate of return, the lower
the total pension liabilities will be. The GASB 67 guidelines give funds wide
latitude to set their assumed rate of return. The reported data used to
construct the previous figure all assume an annual rate of return above 7%.
This, however, is misguided as such a rate of return requires investment in
risky assets.</p>
<p>The key flaw in these assumptions is that funds are allowed to implicitly
assume that the assets and liabilities of the fund are equally as risky. This
is not necessarily the case. The graphs below show the portfolio allocation of
each pension fund. The asset mix of all three funds is heavily titled toward
equities, which tend to be higher risk assets, as opposed to fixed income.
Pension liabilities, on the other hand, are much more certain, i.e. less risky,
than suggested by the asset mix of these funds.</p>
<p><img src="figs/California_Teachers_portfolio_allocation.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><img src="figs/California_PERF_portfolio_allocation.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><img src="figs/UC_portfolio_allocation.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>To provide both a more conservative picture of the health of pension funds and
one that treats pension liabilities as more certain (less risky), pension fund
liabilities should be computed using, for example, risk free rates of return.
One commonly used measure of the risk free rate of return is the return on 10
year treasury bonds. The graph below shows the position of these three pension
funds using a risk free rate of 2.0%. The difference between the data reported
and that implied by a risk free rate is quite stark. The total liabilities and
unfunded ratio of each fund roughly doubles. While both the reported data and
adjusted data presented below highlight the difficulty of funding these pension
systems, the adjusted data shows that substantially more work must be done to
balance budgets than may be recognized by local governments.</p>
