With their help we are able to provide timely information to our community and to hire and train undergraduate students in data collection and analysis. I would also like to thank our Board of Directors for their guidance and thoughtful advice. David Marshall, Executive Vice Chancellor at UCSB deserves special mention for supporting the EFP throughout the years. Thanks to Kenneth Freeland, our business officer who manages the day to day operations. Thomas Fullagar and Sarah Papich, Ph.D. students in the Economics Department, oversee data collection, content and also work with the undergrad interns to produce this document. Despite the best efforts of the pandemic and the Fed, the economy keeps rolling along, hardly missing a beat. While the pandemic created turmoil never before seen, the labor market weathered the storm and has climbed back to where we are now about 3.3 million more employees than the pre-pandemic level in February of 2021. The unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since the late 1960’s. Santa Barbara county has also shown to be a resilient economy. 2022 saw an increase in employment of 8,733 workers compared to 2021. The unemployment rate in the county fell to 3.52% at the end of 2022. However, across the county there was a large discrepancy. The unemployment rate in Santa Maria stood at 5.62% while it was only 0.1% in Santa Ynez Valley. Leisure and hospitality employment in Santa Barbara has come back strongly since the nose dive during the pandemic while retail employment continues to decline. The declining employment in retail in Santa Barbara began in 2000. It is unclear what is driving the decline since retail employment in Ventura county has increased substantially and San Luis Obispo has seen a small gain.

As of 12/31/2023, small banks’ net income is -428.26% lower than the same time last year. Both small and large banks exceeded their pre-recession levels for return on assets. FDIC Call Reports are released for all banks in the U.S., providing financial statement information to the public that is otherwise unavailable for private companies. The Local Finance section reports and analyzes banks that have a presence in Santa Barbara County. Using the data from FDIC Summary of Deposits, we examine each bank’s activity and health on a local level. For banks with an international presence, we are not able to factor out their international operations due to limitations in the data provided by the FDIC Call Reports. Therefore, 6 out of the 19 institutions have an aggregated total of both domestic and foreign operations for their assets and liabilities. The difference makes up about 4% of the total – which does not materially change the analysis on a local level. In this section, we have two categories: large banks and small banks. Large banks are banks that operate on both regional and national levels; whereas, small banks are comprised of solely regional banks and banks with less than $2 billion in total assets. Big banks in this year’s data include Rabobank, Union Bank, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, First Republic Bank, Bank of the West, The Northern Trust Company, Pacific Western Bank, U.S. Bank, Citizens Business Bank, First Bank, and Banc of California. For our analysis on small banks, we have included American Riviera Bank, Community West Bank, Pacific Premier Bank, Montecito Bank &amp; Trust, Community Bank of Santa Maria, Bank of the Sierra, and Farmers and Merchants Bank of Long Beach. The data in this section has been adjusted for inflation; therefore, all numbers in the section are in terms of 2009 dollars. Nominal numbers have been adjusted to real numbers on a quarterly basis with the CPI from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, giving us a more comparable analysis of banking trends, particularly in times of large price movements. Moreover, all metrics describe totals for the industry unless otherwise specified. 1.1.1 Savings and Time Deposits Deposits held by banks represent the vast majority of liabilities for both categories. As of 12/31/2023, large regional banks held 90.17% of their total liabilities as deposits, an increase from 83.46% the same time last year. On the other hand, small regional banks held 62.86% of their total liabilities as domestic deposits, down -9.21 percentage points from last year. Since deposits represent such a large percentage of total liabilities, it is important to understand the trends within each bank category in order to understand where consumers are depositing money. Small and large banks display different trends in terms of deposits as a percentage of total liabilities. Until 2020, large banks had been steadily increasing their deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, while small banks showed more volatility. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, large banks experienced a significant decline in this percentage, which then surged to a historic high in the following year. Recently, deposits as a percentage of total liabilities in large banks have been quite volatile. In contrast, small banks have shown a steep declining trend in this percentage over the past few years. Since the Great Recession, both small and large banks have increased their percent of deposits as a fraction of liabilities. This trend peaked for small regional banks at 91.05% on 06/30/2021, 10.34 percentage points higher than at the end of 2007. Deposits as a fraction of liabilities for large banks peaked at 92.3% on 12/31/2021, 41.73 percentage points higher than it was at the end of 2007. In 2023, the banking industry in Santa Barbara County consisted of 18 institutions with $15,354,019,000 in deposits. Compared with the previous year, there was an increase of 5.79% in deposits with an increase in the number of banks. The numbers in the table below are in nominal terms since the change in CPI from 2022 to 2023 was small, making the deposits relatively comparable. Citizens Business Bank experienced the largest increase in deposits with a change of 105.96%. U.S. Bank had the largest decline in deposits, falling from $67,524,000 to $1,796,334,000 or -96.24%. As banks know when their deposits will be measured every year, we cannot rule out some level of manipulation of deposits that leads to large fluctuations.

Ranging from 0 to 1, the HHI is found by summing the squared market shares of all the firms. When the HHI is 0, a market has a large number of equally sized firms; on the other hand, when the HHI is 1, a market has only one firm. According to the Department of Justice, any market with a HHI between 0.15 and 0.25 is considered to be moderately concentrated. When a market exceeds 0.25, the Department of Justice finds it to be a concentrated market, which may require further review before any mergers can occur. For Santa Barbara County, the current HHI is 0.1165. Therefore, the current banking industry in Santa Barbara is un-concentrated. The HHI for the County increased by 29.3% compared with last year’s HHI of 0.0901. 1.1.3 Loans and Leases In the past year, loans and leases appear to be trending downwards for large banks, while small banks experience some fluctuations. The average quarterly growth rate for large banks between 12/31/2022 and 12/31/2023 was -5.74%, a decrease from that of 5.56% during the year prior. Since the first quarter of 2007, the average quarterly growth rate of loans and leases for large banks has been 0.99%. Between 12/31/2022 and 12/31/2023, small banks saw an average quarterly rise in loans and leases of 5.2%, lower than their average growth rate over the previous year, which was 0.2%. In total, loans and leases for these banks rose from $26,296,641 to $32,212,808. The average quarterly growth rate of loans and leases since the first quarter of 2007 is 4.61%. Both small and large banks saw sharp increases in loans throughout 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent quantitative easing policies. Loans have seen some small dropoff starting in 2021 for both large and small banks. 1.1.4 Net Income Real net income decreased by -428.26% for small banks between 2022 and 2023, falling from $246,935 to $-810,578. Small banks’ net income has recovered tremendously after seeing losses in 2009 and 2010. For large banks, net income increased by 7.59%, reversing the upward trend of the past few years. Since the collapse of the financial markets in 2008, banks have experienced a healthy rebound. Although, simply looking at the value of net income does not account for the increase in the size of many banks. In order to take this into account, we divide total net income for the industry in a given year by the industry’s year end total assets to calculate the industry’s Return on Assets (ROA). The ROA graph demonstrates the industry’s return on assets this year compared with that in 2007. Both small and large banks have surpassed their pre-recession levels in 2019. In 2014, the total return on assets for both large and small banks declined, but there appears to be a robust rebound. As of the end of 2023, large banks stand 62.06% higher than 2007 return on assets while small banks are now 422.29% lower than 2007 levels. 1.1.5 Pension The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College collects public plan-level data for 220 states and local pension plans since 2001. Among these plans, we focus specifically on four pension systems: California PERF, University of California Retirement Plan, California State Teachers’ Retirement System, and Colorado Public Employee Retirement Association-School Division. When it comes to evaluating the performance of investments, there are a few key measures that investors can consider. The net pension liability (NPL) is a measure of the difference between the present value of pension benefits earned by employees and the assets available to pay for those benefits. All four pension groups have seen a steady increase in their net pension liability over the years, indicating potential funding challenges in meeting their pension obligations. During the pandemic, we observed a clear decline in the net pension liability of California PERF and California Teachers because the strong performance of the stock market significantly boosted the value of pension fund investments, especially in equities, leading to a marked improvement in the funded status of plans like CalPERS and CalSTRS. This substantial growth in asset values directly reduced the net pension liability. Since the base year of 2010, the NPL for California PERF, University of California, California Teachers, and Colorado School has increased by 115.78%, 169.39%, 58.06%, and 44.61% respectively, as of 2022. The rise in NPL for University of California is particularly notable, which can be attributed to a combination of factors, including longer life expectancies, lower investment returns, and changes to actuarial assumptions. While NPL helps to assess the financial risk associated with a pension plan, the pension funding ratio can serve as a crucial metric for evaluating the financial soundness of a pension plan by assessing the correlation between its assets and liabilities. It is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the value of the plan’s assets by the value of its liabilities. A funding ratio of 100% or greater indicates that a plan has enough assets to cover its liabilities, while a ratio below 100% indicates a shortfall. The four pension plans all have become increasingly underfunded over the years, which is a cause for concern for their ability to provide retirement benefits to current and future retirees. Among all four plans, the University of California plan has consistently held the highest funding ratio among all four plans, albeit experiencing considerable declines from 147.73% in 2001 to 83.45% in 2022, which points to a substantial underfunding concern. Percent fair value change is a measure that tells us how much the fair value of an asset or liability has changed over a specific period of time, expressed as a percentage of its original value. The percent fair value change of each fund varies widely from year to year. All four pension plans had experienced significant losses in 2008 and 2009 due to the financial crisis. However, they were all able to bounce back to the original level within one to two years. As of 2022, the fair market value change for each pension plan is -8.98%, -11.8%, -4.33%, and -14.88% respectively. These numbers highlight the varying levels of success that each pension plan has had in maintaining or increasing their fair market value. It’s worth noting that there are a variety of factors that can influence the fair value change of an asset or liability, including market conditions, economic factors, and geopolitical events. In addition, comparing the long run return to the assumed return can help investors evaluate the performance of their investments. If an investment consistently achieves a return that is lower than the assumed return, investors may want to consider reallocating their investments to other assets or strategies. In 2001, the University of California plan had the highest positive return of 6.04% compared to the assumed return. Since then, the four pension plans tend to rise and decline together, exhibiting a similar trend pattern across time periods. In 2022, the difference between long-run and assumed return for each pension plan is 0.2%, 0.85%, 2.4%, and 0.75% respectively. From the perspective of state and local governments, one of the key challenges to balancing budgets is the need to fund pension systems. Three of the largest pension funds that affect our local community are calPERS, calTeachers, and UCRP. The reported total pension liabilities of each pension fund is $329 billion, $139 billion, and $88 billion respectively. Each of these funds reports an unfunded ratio, i.e. fraction of liabilities for which there are insufficient fund assets, of 27.44%, 28.39%, and 20.5%, respectively. The liabilities data reported by pension funds while informative are misleading. In particular, annual financial reports produced by pension funds follow what are known as the GASB 67 guidelines. A crucial assumption necessary to calculate total pension liabilities is the assumed return of fund assets. The reported data all assume an annual rate of return above 7%. The key flaw in these assumptions is that funds are allowed to implicitly assume that the assets and liabilities of the fund are equally as risky. This is not necessarily the case. The graphs below show the portfolio allocation of each pension fund. The asset mix of all these pension funds is heavily tilted toward equities, which tend to be higher risk assets, as opposed to fixed income. Pension liabilities, on the other hand, are much more certain, i.e. less risky, than suggested by the asset mix of these funds. To provide both a more conservative picture of the health of pension funds and one that treats pension liabilities as more certain (less risky), pension fund liabilities should be computed using, for example, risk free rates of return. One commonly used measure of the risk free rate of return is the return on 10 year treasury bonds. The graph below shows the position of these three pension funds using a risk free rate of 2.0%. The difference between the data reported and that implied by a risk free rate is quite stark. The total liabilities and unfunded ratio of each fund roughly doubles. While both the reported data and adjusted data presented below highlight the difficulty of funding these pension systems, the adjusted data shows that substantially more work must be done to balance budgets than may be recognized by local governments. 1.2 Oil and Gas Key Points: California’s production of crude oil has been declining since the late 1980s and decreased by 10.72% between 2022 and 2023. Crude oil prices increased by 10.91% from July 2022 to July 2023. California’s field production of crude oil has been decreasing every year since 2014. Oil production decreased in 2023 by 10.72% compared to the decrease in oil production in 2022 of 6.57%. In 2021, oil production decreased by 5.35%. From 2019 to 2020, oil production decreased by 5.35%. In addition, oil prices have been increasing sharply from their lowest-ever price of in April 2020. Oil prices rose by 10.91% from July 2022 to July 2023. So far in 2023, the price for WTI-Texas has averaged $78.23, compared with an average of $78.3 in 2022. From July 2021 to 2022, oil prices decreased by -38%. Of particular note during 2022 is the sharp increase in oil prices resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. However, price growth has started to slow down, with the average price of oil declining from June to July of 2022. 1.2.1 Federal Offshore Oil Production Federal offshore oil production has been declining since the mid-1990s and has now reached the lowest level in the recorded data. So far in 2023, federal offshore oil production has averaged 1858.58 thousand barrels per month, a -17.99% decrease compared with the average of 2266.29 thousand barrels per month in 2022. At its peak in 2009, federal offshore oil production reached 6,312 barrels per month. 1.3 Agriculture Key Points Total crop value increased by 0.64%, from $1.92 billion in 2021 to $1.93 billion in 2022. The total value of strawberries, the county’s highest-grossing crop, increased by 1.3% from $800.5 million in 2021 to $810.9 million in 2022. Total sales of wine grapes reached 96.33 in 2022, a decrease of -8% compared with 2021. 1.3.1 Total Crop Production The total crop value in 2022 was $1.93, an increase of 0.64% from the prior year. This represents a decline in growth compared with the previous year, when the total crop value increased by 5%. Total harvested acres of vegetables, fruits, nuts and field crops decreased by 1.02%. 1.3.2 Leading Crops Production of strawberries, the county’s highest-grossing crop for the past 20 years, had a gross value of $810.9 million in 2022. This represents a 1.3% increase in gross value of strawberry crops from 2021, which was $800.5 million. The value of the strawberry crop has nearly doubled in the past decade, and the pace of growth was particularly fast in the past two years. From 2020 to 2021, the strawberry crop’s value grew by 10.05%. Broccoli’s crop value declined in 2022, decreasing from $101.371 million the previous year to $93.375 million. The 7.89% decrease in gross value continued the trend from the previous year, when the value of the broccoli crop declined by 3%. Total harvested acres of vegetables, the category that includes broccoli, decreased by -14.76%. The Santa Barbara County wine grape crop value fell by -8% from $105.15 million in 2021 to $96.33 in 2022. The average price per ton of wine grapes grown in Santa Barbara County increased by 20.13% to $2,353. The average price per ton from 2004 to 2022 was $1,613, well below the price in the past year. The avocado crop value plummeted by 10% from $50.726 million in 2021 to $59.65 million in 2022. By comparison, the value of the avocado crop increased by -36.72% from 2020 to 2021. The average annual value of the avocado crop from 2004 to 2022 is $47.78 million. In recent years, the avocado crop has experienced more volatility in its value than many other crops. 1.3.3 Wine Grape Production In Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties, the average price of white wine grapes in 2022 was $2143.21 and the average price of red wine grapes was $2147.29. The average price of grapes in the Central Coast region is typically higher than the statewide average. Production of red wine exceeds production of white wine in the tri-county area: in 2022, this region crushed 188266.3 tons of red grapes and only 59688 tons of white grapes. Santa Barbara is best known for its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, the former of which cost $1696.85 per ton and the latter of which cost $2101.65 per ton in 2022. The most heavily produced type of wine in the tri-county area is Cabernet Sauvignon, at 95630.8 tons in 2022. 1.3.4 Drought Recovery In 2022, 7.44% of California was in a severe drought, a -92% decrease from the average in 2021. So far in 2023, the percent of California in a severe or moderate drought has decreased by -100% and -100%. However, the percent of the state in the most severe drought categories of exceptional drought and extreme drought has changed by -100% and 0%, respectively. The percent of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties in the most severe category of exceptional drought has declined substantially since 2014. However, the vast majority of the land in all three counties remained either abnormally dry or in a moderate drought, highlighting the importance of continued water conservation efforts despite improvement in drought status in the last several years. In 2023, the percent of three counties in drought are very low or close to zero, which suggests that all three areas have received sufficient precipitation and have adequate water resources to meet their needs.

The Finance industry was the largest contributor to Real GDP in Santa Barbara. The Professional &amp; Business Services industry was the second largest contributor in 2022 and Government followed with the third largest contribution to real GDP in Santa Barbara. Arts was the fastest increasing industry in 2022, with an increase in GDP contribution of 8.7%. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the value of all goods and services produced within a certain location over a certain period of time. It remains one of the best measures of economic growth and well-being, not only for the nation but also for local areas. Unlike the data on national GDP, data on GDP for Santa Barbara County is only reported annually and at a considerable lag. Typically, we rely on alternative measures to judge the health of our local economy like employment statistics and housing prices, which are released more frequently. However, GDP remains a relevant statistic to determine long-run trends in the county’s economic growth and industry mix. It also allows for a direct comparison to growth in the nation and state. Real GDP growth in Santa Barbara County for 2022 by -0.7%. Over the last decade, Santa Barbara County had seen steady growth in real GDP, with an average growth of 2.58%. In 2021, Santa Barbara County saw the highest real GDP growth rate of 6.8% over the past ten years, while the lowest increase in real GDP occurred in 2022, with only a -0.7% rise. U.S. real GDP decreased by 2.8% in 2020, but has since increased by nearly 6% in 2021. This is above and beyond what is typical, illustrating how the economy was able to bounce back after the pandemic. Real GDP also fell in California by 2.3% in 2020, a large decrease from a 3.2% growth in 2019. As of 2022, the real GDP in the United States had risen by 1.9%, while California recorded a lower growth rate of 0.7% in its real GDP. Real GDP increased by 1.6% in 2022 for San Luis Obispo County. From 2010 to 2019, San Luis Obispo has had nine consecutive years of positive real GDP growth rates. However, the year 2020 marked a break in this trend with a negative growth rate of -3.0%. In 2021, San Luis Obispo recorded its highest growth rate of the past decade, with a 3.2% increase. Real GDP for Ventura County increased by -0.4% in 2022. Similarly, Ventura County experienced a 2.6% decrease in real GDP in 2020. This was the first decrease for Ventura County since 2016, when real GDP decreased by 0.7%. Industry Growth In Santa Barbara County, the largest five industries in 2022 were Finance, Professional &amp; Business Services, Government, Manufacturing, and Educational Services in that order. All of these industries were also part of the five largest industries in 2021, with Finance still leading. Professional &amp; Business Services was the second largest industry in 2021 and Government followed in third. The fastest growing industry in 2022 was Arts, which experienced GDP growth of 8.7% from 2021. The second-fastest growing industry in Santa Barbara County was Information, with GDP growth of 5%. Other Services had the third largest growth rate in 2022 at 4.8%, and Finance had the fifth largest growth rate at -0.1%. The five industries with the weakest growth in 2022 were Mining (-11.2%), Agriculture (-10.7%), Construction (-9%), Wholesale Trade (-4.2%), and Transportation (-4.2%). Per Capita GDP Real GDP per capita for Santa Barbara County in 2022 was $70,165, reflecting a decrease of 2.13% compared to the previous year. This was higher than San Luis Obispo County ($62,974) and Ventura County ($63,262). Santa Barbara County’s real GDP per capita was higher than that of the United States’ value of $65,420, but it was lower than California’s real GDP per capita of $81,132. Due to the pandemic, there was a general decline in real GDP per capita in the year 2020, as evidenced by the data. However, the economy has shown signs of recovery in 2021, as we observe an increase in real GDP per capita. 2.2 Prices Key Points: Core inflation, which removes the effects of energy and food prices, decreased by 0.4% from January 2022 to January 2023 in the United States, and decreased by 1% in the Los Angeles Area. The Federal Reserve’s long-term inflation target of 2% was significantly exceeded in 2023, with the core CPI for the U.S. reaching 4.77%. The main measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This index is calculated by taking the change in prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed basket of goods and services, which is representative of what a typical consumer purchases. In 2023, the CPI for the Los Angeles Area increased by 5.77%. The overall U.S. inflation in 2023 increased by a similar percentage, at 6.36%. Core CPI is often thought of as the best measure of inflation. It resolves issues and concerns regarding volatility by removing food and energy from the basket of goods and services. By this measure, inflation was 3.8% in the Los Angeles area for 2023. Los Angeles consistently had a higher core CPI than the US from 2015 to 2020, but the trend did not persist in 2021-2023. The core CPI value for the U.S. was 1% higher than the value for Los Angeles in 2023. The FED hit their long-term inflation target of 2.0% for the first time in 2016 since 2008. The inflation rate decreased drastically in 2023 for Los Angeles, but still hitting high above the FED’s target. It dropped from 5.76% in 2022 to 3.76% in 2023. The FED was highly above their 2.0% benchmark in 2023 with the core CPI for the U.S. being 4.77%. In the Los Angeles Area, the quarterly percentage change for the CPI for energy experienced a decline of 10.7% at the end of 2023, while the corresponding change for the entire United States was a decline of 3.86%. "],["inflation-and-retail-sales.html", "3 Inflation and Retail Sales 3.1 Inflation 3.2 Retail Sales", " 3 Inflation and Retail Sales 3.1 Inflation The inflation rate is measured by calculating the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services commonly purchased by consumers, over a specific period of time. The CPI for all items measures the changes in prices for all goods and services, while the CPI for all items less food and energy measures the changes in prices for goods and services excluding food and energy, which are often volatile. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on inflation rates, with the inflation rate experiencing a sharp decrease in March 2020, dropping to 0.4% compared to 2.34% in January 2020. This was the largest monthly drop since the 2008 financial crisis. The pandemic also led to a recession, with many businesses shutting down, leading to reduced economic activity and decreased consumer spending. As a result, inflation rates remained low for several months. However, inflation rates have since rebounded and are now a concern for policymakers. As of 2024, the CPI rose 0.44% in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, after increasing 0.31% in January. The CPI for all items less food and energy rose 0.36% in February, after rising 0.39% in January Over the last 12 months, the all items CPI increased 3.17% before seasonal adjustment; this was the smallest 12-month increase since the period ending June 2022, which had an inflation rate of 8.93%. The all items less food and energy CPI rose 3.76% over the last 12 months. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a significant impact on the money supply. In response to the economic impact of the pandemic, governments and central banks around the world have implemented various measures to increase the money supply and stimulate economic activity. M1 money supply includes currency, demand deposits, and other highly liquid accounts known as “other checkable deposits” (OCDs), whereas M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds. The current value of M1 supply is $18 trillion, and M2 supply stands at $21 trillion as of January 2024. Before April 24, 2020, savings accounts were not considered part of M1. However, the limitations on the number of transfers from savings accounts were lifted on April 24, making them just as liquid and convenient as currency, demand deposits, and OCDs. As a result, savings accounts are now included in M1, along with currency, demand deposits, and a new item called “other liquid deposits,” which consists of both OCDs and savings deposits. This has led to a substantial increase in the value of M1, from $5 trillion under the old definition to $16 trillion under the new definition, and represents a clear break in the time series. The increase in M1 was also driven by quantitative easing policies implemented by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative easing (QE) involves the central bank purchasing large amounts of financial assets, such as government bonds, in order to inject liquidity into the financial system and stimulate economic activity. By increasing the supply of money in the economy, the Federal Reserve hoped to lower interest rates, make borrowing cheaper, and encourage spending and investment. In March 2020, the Fed announced a program of unlimited QE, which involved purchasing at least $500 billion in Treasury securities and at least $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities1. By June 2020, the Fed’s balance sheet had increased by over $3 trillion from pre-pandemic levels, and by March 2022, it had reached a record high of over $9 trillion. In times of high inflation or significant economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve often utilizes the federal funds rate as a primary tool to get things back in order. The federal funds rate is determined by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which assesses a variety of key economic indicators in order to determine whether to increase or decrease rates. One key signal is the inflation rate. According to the Federal Reserve, an inflation rate of 2% represents an optimal balance between employment levels and price stability. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recession, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. The decision to lower the interest rate was made in response to the economic shock caused by the pandemic and the resulting lockdowns, which led to a significant decline in economic activity and a sharp increase in unemployment. The Federal Reserve believed that lowering interest rates would stimulate economic activity and help stabilize financial markets. Currently, the target rate is 5.25% to 5.5%, with the most recent rate increase of 25 basis points during the Fed’s March meeting in 2023. The Taylor Rule, a monetary-policy “rule” that the nominal interest rate should be set in response to changes in inflation and output, prescribes a higher federal funds rate when inflation is above the Fed’s inflation target level of 2%, and a lower one if inflation falls below the target. The equation is typically written as2 \\[i=2+\\pi+\\frac{1}{2}(\\pi-2)+\\frac{1}{2}(q-q^*)\\] where \\(i\\) is the nominal interest rate, \\(\\pi\\) is the current inflation rate, \\(q\\) is the level of output or economic activity, and \\(q^*\\) is the central bank’s target level of output, so \\((q - q^*)\\) is the deviation of real quarterly output from a linear trend to measure the output gap. The Taylor Rule suggested nominal interest rates should have been about 5.36% by the end of 2023 Q4. Going forward, if the Taylor Rule is any indication, the federal funds rate should be set at a high level since the current inflation is above the Fed’s targeted level. 3.2 Retail Sales Key Points Retail sales growth continued its steady climb throughout the entirety of 2024 at an average growth rate of 1.22% every quarter. With 19.29% of total taxable sales, Food Services and Drinking Places remained the largest industry in the county. Buellton had the largest one-year growth in total sales of 19.05%, and Guadalupe had the least one-year increase in growth of 4.49%. Retail sales experienced fluctuations throughout 2024. The annualized growth rates by quarter were -10.58%, 14.11%, -1.42%, and 2.77%, respectively. The 4-quarter moving average for retail sales in the county remained steady, slightly increasing throughout the year. Overall, growth was weaker than in 2023: average quarterly growth was 1.22%, compared to 4.04% in 2023. Disaggregated by industry, the top two industries (excluding Other Retail Group) by percentage of total sales was represented by Food Services and Drinking Places at the top with 19.29% of sales, followed by Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers at 14.29%. The top three industries by number of permits, excluding Other Retail Group, were Food Services and Drinking Places at 1,583, Clothing and Clothing Accessories Stores at 1,077, and Food and Beverage Stores at 485. Santa Barbara County ranked 21st out of 58 counties in terms of sales growth in 2024, which is worse than the county’s rank of 13th in 2023. The county of Trinity experienced the largest decrease in total sales with a drop of 13.51%. Five counties experienced decreases in total sales from 2023 to `r currYear`: Humboldt, Inyo, Lake, Mendocino and Trinity counties. In 2024, all cities within Santa Barbara County increased in total sales. `r citysalesN4`Buellton showed impressive growth of 19.05%, the highest in the county. Not only did Buellton have the highest overall retail sales growth, it was also the highest in sales growth per capita. On the other hand, Guadalupe grew 4.49% in per capita sales, while Lompoc grew 2.48% during 2024. In Buellton, the taxable sales per capita stands at $58,083, or 231% of the county average of $25,116, while in Guadalupe the taxable sales per capita is only $5,381, or 21.43% of the county average. This is a massive difference within the same county, with Buellton’s taxable sales per capita at almost eleven times that of Guadalupe. https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm↩︎ https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200718/index.html↩︎ "],["employment-and-income.html", "4 Employment and Income 4.1 Employment 4.2 Forecast 4.3 Occupations 4.4 Income", " 4 Employment and Income 4.1 Employment Key Points Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries grew by 725 jobs in 2023, a gain of 0.35%. The unemployment rate increased in 2023, rising by 0.47 percentage points to 4.12%. Santa Ynez Valley has the lowest unemployment rate in the county at 0.1% and Santa Maria has the highest unemployment rate in the county at 6.13%. 4.1.1 Santa Barbara County Employment Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries continued to grow in 2023. Total Employment increased from 208,541 jobs in 2022 to 209,266 jobs in 2023. This gain of 725 workers represents an increase of 0.35%, which is lower than the previous year’s growth rate of 0.21%. Since December of 2013, Santa Barbara County has a net gain of 8,541 jobs, averaging an increase of 854 jobs each year. This is a sign that the labor markets in Santa Barbara County are healthy. Nonfarm payroll in California increased in 2023, at a rate of 0.21%. Since December of 2013, nonfarm payrolls have increased in California by 8.88%. United States nonfarm payroll has also increased at a rate of 1.73%. This is significantly higher than the 2021 growth rate of 1.39%. Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll growth increased by 0.35%, which is slightly lower compared to California. This is higher than the 2021 growth rate of 0.13%. Nonfarm payroll is indexed to July 2009, and since the end of the recession, Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll gains (3.67%) have been lower than both the United States’ (15.13%) and California’s (13.56%). The average number of unemployed workers and the unemployment rate has also improved in the past year. The unemployment rate dropped from a peak of 14.6% in 2021 to, based on the most recent data, 4.3% in 2023. The number unemployed, defined as workers who are without work and are actively seeking work, has increased from a peak of 7,900 in 2021, to 10,066 in 2022, and then down to 8,983 in 2023. This drop of 1,083 unemployed workers in the past year represents a decline of 13.7%. The declines in both variables have been gradually slowing down as the labor market returns to so-called “full employment”, loosely defined as the lowest possible level that will not cause inflation. If unemployment falls significantly, inflation will rise as employers compete to hire workers and push up wages too fast. The size of the labor force in Santa Barbara County has increased from 2022 to 2023 by 1,800 workers. This is a small increase of 0.83%. 4.1.2 Santa Barbara County Industries The next three figures show employment growth for 14 industries in Santa Barbara County over the past year, three years and ten years. The height of each bar shows the growth rate and the width shows the percent of total employment for each industry for 2019, 2017, and 2010 respectively. Industry with largest employment growth had the largest employment growth with a 1.30% growth rate over the past year. Industry with largest employment decline saw the largest employment decline of 2.46% over the past year. Industry with highest employment remains the largest industry by employment, with 58.45% of total employment, followed by Industry with second highest employment (50.72%) and Industry with third highest employment (44.55%). Over the past three years, Total Wage and Salary saw the largest increase in employment, with a three-year growth rate of 8.92%. Government have seen the largest employment declines over the past three years with declines of 3.06%. Since 2013, the percent of total employment for most industries has not significantly changed. Total Wage and Salary has grown the most, as it now has an employment share of 14.98%. Total Farm has increased its employment share from 5.74% to 7.72% as it now has the fifth largest employment share. Employment shares by industry have generally stayed the same within the past twenty years. The largest increase since 2003 is in the Total Wage and Salary industry, as their employment share has risen to 58.45%. Goods Producing, Professional and Business Services, Retail Trade, Manufacturing, and Financial Services have seen small declines since 2003. The figures below depict the employment time series for the following industries: Total Nonfarm, Total Farm, Goods Producing, Services Providing, and the six largest 2-digit industries in Santa Barbara County. The dark blue line shows the original data series reported by the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the light blue line shows the seasonally adjusted data that the EFP has created. Some industries’ employment, like Total Farm, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Retail Trade, appear to be highly seasonal. Other industries, like Manufacturing and Education and Health Services, have almost no seasonal component. Employment in Leisure and Hospitality, Education and Health Services, and Professional and Business Services are all enjoying upward trends over this period. Employment in Goods Producing and Manufacturing has also seen recent upward trends after realizing declines after the Recession. Employment in Retail Trade has been declining since peaking in 2015. 4.1.3 City Data Current unemployment rates are highest in Santa Maria (6.13%), Lompoc (5.19%), and Guadalupe (5.10%). Unemployment rates are lowest in Santa Ynez Valley (0.10%) and Buellton (1.83%). Unemployment rates in all areas have declined significantly since 2011, when several North County cities had unemployment rates around 12%. Industry employment differs substantially from city to city. We show the industry employment mix for each area in the figure on the next page. The length of the bar represents the percentage of an area’s employment coming from a particular industry. Some of the interesting facts that appear in this data are: *** Industry data does not exist at the city level. 4.1.4 California Counties Labor markets all across California vary significantly as counties labor markets are dependent on their geographical region. Santa Barbara’s labor market compares well to most counties in California. However, they aren’t as strong as some counties in Northern California, and specifically those counties in the Bay Area. This section will provide some data and a map visualization to show how labor markets differ across California’s 58 counties. Santa Barbara’s unemployment rate (4.12%) is above average relative to other California counties. Santa Barbara has the 17th lowest unemployment rate among all California counties. The county with the lowest unemployment rate is San Mateo County (3.04%), which is part of San Francisco’s Bay Area. The top four counties with the lowest unemployment are all from Northern California: San Mateo County (3.04%), San Francisco County (3.26%), Marin County (3.32%), and San Luis Obispo County (3.45%). The three counties with the highest unemployment rate in the state are Imperial County (17.23%), Colusa County (13.04%), and Tulare County (9.99%). These counties also had the highest unemployment rates in 2022 as well. No other California counties have unemployment rates above 7%. Most California counties’ unemployment rates fall between 3% and 5%. All California counties saw a decrease in their unemployment rate compared to 2021 levels. Imperial County saw the largest decrease in the unemployment rate (17.23 percentage points) followed by Colusa County (13.04 percentage points). Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll grew by 0.35%, which is higher than the majority of California counties. Santa Barbara had the 36th highest growth rate in the state, in contrast to recent years. The strongest growth in nonfarm payroll were in Alpine County (8.33%), Mono County (5.67%), Mariposa County (4.23%), and Inyo County (2.45%). Several counties had declines in nonfarm payrolls over the past year, led by San Mateo County (-1.47%) and Lassen County (-1.47%). 2 counties saw nonfarm payroll grow over 5% annually. 4.1.5 Firm Size Data Since 2022, firm size distribution in Santa Barbara has remained relatively the same. In 2022, the most common number of employees at a firm in Santa Barbara is between 20-49 employees, and this has been unchanged since 2012. Even though it is still the most common number of employees, the proportion of firms with this range of employees has increased from the 2012 level of 18.1% to 18.8% in 2022. Firms with 50-99 employees saw the greatest decline in firm size distribution since 2008. In 2008, firms with 50-99 employees accounted for nearly 15% of firm size distribution, where in 2018; these firms only account 12.5% of firm size distribution. In 2022, firms with 250-499 employees had the largest average payroll expenditure per employee at $18,634. Looking across all different firm sizes, we can see that payroll per employee has increased in almost all firm size categories. The largest changes in payroll per employee from 2012 to 2022 were in firms with 250-499 employees and firms with 50-99 employees. These firms saw payroll per employee increases of 43.2% and 36.6% respectively. In Santa Barbara County, 39.8% of employees work for firms that employ over 100 workers. This is 5.5 percentage points less than California, where 45.3% of employees work for firms with over 100 workers. These numbers have converged in recent years. We can also see that in Santa Barbara County most Retail Trade Services employees work for firms with 100-249 employees, while most Agriculture employees work for larger firms. Santa Barbara County’s firm size distribution difference between California’s is the proportion of workers in small businesses. For California, 54.7% of employees work in firms with less than 100 employees. The distribution is much larger in Santa Barbara County, where 60.2% of employees work in firms with less than 100 employees. Besides the difference in employee distribution in firms with less than 100 workers, Santa Barbara County and California’s firm size distribution are similar. The only major difference is in firms with 1000+ employees, as 15.6% of California employees work in firms of the largest size. Only 8.8% of Santa Barbara employees work in firms with 1000+ workers, although this number is significantly larger than it has been in recent years. 4.2 Forecast Key Points Nonfarm Payrolls are expected to grow at a rate of 0.87% in the upcoming year, an increase of 1,915 jobs. While this growth rate is high by historical standards, it is lower than the 0.94% growth observed in 2022. Our statistical forecast suggests a 2023 December unemployment rate of 4.7%, an increase of 0.57 percentage points compared with December 2022. The 95% confidence interval spans from a low of 0.84% to a high of 8.56%. The forecasting methods used in this section are based on the Census Bureau’s X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Their program can be used to forecast a series using only its statistical features. Each employment series has a seasonal component (the December effect for retail trade is one example), a trend component (like the long-run downward trend in goods-producing industries or a multi-year recession), and an irregular component (a one-month bump or decline in the series for reasons that will not occur again, like the 2012 Olympics producing a one-month bump in the London economy). After decomposing a time-series into these three components, the current trend component and seasonal component can be used to forecast the series. While the irregular series cannot be predicted, since it has an expected value of zero, and systematic changes to the trend and seasonal components also cannot be predicted, the history of how these components have varied in the past can be used to generate confidence intervals. Each figure in this section shows the recent unadjusted and seasonally adjusted series followed by a three-year forecast. This forecast describes the most likely values for the unadjusted series. The dashed lines surrounding the forecast describe the 95% confidence interval. There is a 5% chance that values will occur outside of these dashed lines. Unless otherwise noted, each of the following year-over-year projections that we describe in the text will be between 2023 and 2024 for the unadjusted series. Nonfarm Payrolls are expected to grow at a rate of 0.87% in the upcoming year, an increase of 1,915 jobs. While this growth rate is high by historical standards, it is lower than the 0.94% growth observed in 2022. Our statistical forecast suggests a 2023 December unemployment rate of 4.7%, an increase of 0.57 percentage points compared with December 2022. The 95% confidence interval spans from a low of 0.84% to a high of 8.56%. Among industries, the X-13 statistical forecast expects growth in all the industries we depict in the following two pages. Of these industries, Weakest 1 year employment forecast industry is expected to have the weakest performance, expecting to grow by -1.11%, and Strongest 1 year employment forecast industry employment is expected to have the largest growth rate, increasing by 3.48%. The growth in farm employment is expected to continue for the next three years, with an average annual growth rate of 4.12%. 4.3 Occupations The largest occupation in Santa Barbara County is Food Preparation and Serving-Related Occupations with 21,830 workers. Between 2022 and 2023, this occupation increased by 1,020 jobs. This occupation is one of the lower-paying jobs among the top ten largest occupations in the county, with a mean annual wage of $38,704.05. The lowest-paying occupation among the top ten largest occupations is Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse, with a mean annual wage of $36,243.90. Only two of the top ten largest occupations, Management Occupations, Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations, have a mean annual wage above $100,000. Computer and Information Research Scientists, which was not among the top ten largest occupations in 2019, has the next highest mean annual salary of $369,174.24 in quarter 1 of 2023. Within the county, the vast majority of jobs only require high school or less with minimal training (263,550). This group comprises 65.88% of the jobs in the county that have reported education and training requirements. The second largest education group is bachelor’s degree with no experience (21,290). Only 15.76% of jobs in the county require a bachelor’s degree or more. Recent employment projections, described in the 2022 Economic Forecast Project book, suggest that this employment composition will remain constant over the next 11 years, with the vast majority of new jobs having minimal educational and training requirements. Among education groups, the jobs requiring a highest mean annual wage education group have the highest median annual wage at $177,160.31, closely followed by jobs requiring a Bachelor’s degree with some work experience ($108,816.01). For the most part, education &amp; training groups with more requirements pay more, except for postsecondary non-degree award jobs. High school or less with minimal training jobs pay the lowest median annual wages ($43,105.91). This is 86.32% less than the second lowest education &amp; training group, high school or less with moderate training, and 39.61% less than the median annual wage for a bachelor’s degree with no experience. In addition to providing data for individual occupations, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) also aggregates occupations into 22 occupation groups. A summary of the data for these occupation groups is provided in the following pages. Food Preparation and Serving-Related Occupations is the largest occupation group, with 21,830 jobs, and Office and Administrative Support Occupations is the second largest group, with 21,290 jobs. Office and Administrative Support Occupations saw a significant 12.75% employment increase in 2022. The occupation group that saw the largest increase in employment is Medical Transcriptionists. This group saw employment increase by an impressive 6,690 jobs, which is a 12.75% increase from 2022. This is likely the result of this sector rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual wages for the majority of occupations increased in 2022, with the exception of four occupation groups. Obstetricians and Gynecologists had the largest wage increase of 1.53%. There was also strong growth in mean annual wage among Legal Occupations and Protective Service Occupations, each of which saw a gain of 12.9%. 4.4 Income Key Points Real per capita income in Santa Barbara County declined in 2023 at -8.03%. A -6.53% growth rate of California’s real per capita income in 2023 resulted in a per capita income of $79,835, which is slightly lower than Santa Barbara’s real per capita income of $78,471. Santa Barbara County’s real per capita income changed in 2023, from 85,327 to 78,471. The real per capita income growth rate in 2019 was 6.9%, which is higher than the previous year’s growth of 5.9% (The BEA has adjusted its calculations of previous years’ per capita income since our last publication). The rate of growth in Santa Barbara was above California’s growth for 2021, -6.53%, but below that of the United States, -5.08%. US, California, and Santa Barbara County real per capita growth all declined in 2023. Per capita net earnings make up the majority of per capita personal income in the United States, California, and Santa Barbara. Per capita net earnings describe wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions to pensions and insurance funds), and proprietors’ income less contributions for government social insurance and an adjustment to convert earnings from place of work to place of residence. In California and the United States, this component represents about 64.36% and 61.93% of per capita income respectively. However, in Santa Barbara, this component only represents 56.53% of per capita income. The second largest factor in per capita income is formed by dividends, interest, and rent. Dividends, Interest, and rent made up 29.25% of Santa Barbara’s per capita income, 19.57% of California’s, and 19.73% in the United States in 2021. This difference can be attributed to Santa Barbara County’s unusually high income distribution; wealthier people typically earn a higher proportion of their income from investments, which produce dividends, interest, and rents, than lower-income people. Hourly wages in Santa Barbara grew nominally by 4.32% in 2023, from $31.03 to $32.37. Real wages for workers in Computer and Mathematical Occupations and Legal Occupations grew the fastest over the past year, with growth rates of 15.43% and 15.43% respectively. Within the county, Production Occupations experienced the largest real hourly wage decline from 2022 to 2023, losing 15.43%. Pharmacists continue to have the highest real wages in 2023 at $76.09 per hour compared to the average across all occupations of $32.37. *** Poverty statistics unavailable. "],["housing.html", "5 Real Estate 5.1 Residential 5.2 Commercial", " 5 Real Estate 5.1 Residential Real Estate Residential Real Estate Key Points: YoY growth in Santa Barbara County median home values experienced a U-shaped dip throughout 2019 and have since returned to values implied by its secular trend. The Santa Barbara County Housing Affordability Index fell from 11% to 10% over the past year and sits below the average for all of California. The real median home price for Santa Barbara County fell by -28.1% between March 2022 and March 2024 compared to a -7.5% drop increase in California. Residential building activity fell from 1,069 to 408 permitted units in 2020. Santa Barbara County’s housing market continued its growth in terms of home values compared to last year, albeit at a slower rate. From April 2022 to April 2023, the Zillow Home Value Index, an estimate of the median home value, for Santa Barbara County increased from $150 to $153, a 1.98% change. This is down from the prior year’s growth in home values of 25.34%. The median home price in Santa Barbara County as of April 2023 surpassed its pre-recession high of $106 in June 2006. Median prices in both the overall US and California have remained above their pre-recession peaks. None of these geographies experienced gains in Year over Year (YoY) growth rates of home values relative to this time last year. . 2019 also saw a large dip in home value growth beginning in March, reaching a minimum between July and September depending on the region under consideration. Growth and home values have since rebounded. Following the recovery in home value growth rates, i.e. since 2013, YoY growth of Santa Barbara County home values reached a minimum of 1.34% in December 2019. Neighboring San Louis Obispo County has fared worse, reaching a minimum of -0.89% in April 2023. Of particular interest is that, while the United States as a whole also experienced a dip of sorts throughout 2019, the decline and subsequent rebound in YoY growth is most dramatic for California. Given the size of California, and the relative value of its housing market, the 2019 decline in California’s YoY growth may be a large contributing to factor to the apparent nationwide dip during that time period. Zillow’s for-sale inventories data series is no longer available for Santa Barbara County. We have included our previous discussion of this data while we work to instead incorporate home transfer data from the Santa Barbara County Recorder’s Office. Inventories, calculated as the estimated number of median homes for sale in a given region, decreased across all three geographies (Santa Barbara County, California, and the US) following last year’s rebound. Santa Barbara experienced a decline in inventories from a peak of 939 in January 2019 to 614 in March 2020. California saw an even larger decrease in levels, from a peak of 78,265 in December 2018 to 58,293 in March 2020, though the decline in Santa Barbara County was larger in relative terms. This dip in inventories across the United States, while still present, is much smaller than that in both California and Santa Barbara County housing markets and appears to be a return to the Country’s secular trend in inventories beginning in 2013. Take note of the fact that declining inventories could be due to one or more of many different supply and demand forces, and how efficiently real estate markets match buyers with sellers. The health of local housing markets depends crucially on the source of the change in inventories and not simply the stock of inventories itself. Affordability The Housing Affordability Index from the California Association of Realtors gives the percentage of households in California counties that can afford to purchase the median-priced house in their respective areas. Nationally, 35% of United States residents could afford the median-priced house in the country during 2023Q4, an increase of 0.79 percentage points from last quarter and a decrease of -3.04 percentage points relative to last year. California’s Housing Affordability Index is lower than the national average, with 14.66% of California residents being able to afford the median-priced house in the state. Santa Barbara County also falls below the national average, with an index of 0%. This constitutes a a decrease from last quarter’s index of 10% and a decline from last year, when 11% of residents could afford the median-priced house.

In 2007, no areas in Santa Barbara City and Goleta sold homes at a discount. Instead, SB/East of State, SB/Gol North, SB/Gol South, and SB/West of State sold single family homes at a premium. The differences in list and sale prices may be indicative of the relative bargaining power of buyers and sellers in each region. Throughout the County, the lowest sale to list price was 117% in SB/West of State. List prices vary significantly between regions, with Hope Ranch being the most expensive and SB/Gol South being the least expensive. Median list prices for these two geographies are $3,955,625 and $876,917, respectively. SB South Coast: Single Family Home Listings, Sales and Prices Montecito experienced the largest level change in its median sale price, which rose in 2021 from $3,497,187 to $5,005,005. This brings its median home price back in line with historic prices after stark rise in 2018. This level change also represents the largest percentage change in median home prices, adjusting by 43.12%. Santa Barbara North County had the most stable prices in percentage terms with median home prices increasing by 5.07% between 2020 and 2021. In terms of mean home prices, Montecito experienced the largest change: average prices rose from $4,484,542 to $6,433,806. Given that the median price saw a very small decline, it is likely the case that a small number of high value sales is skewing the average for the Montecito area.

Table 1 COMMERCIAL SALES - Full steam ahead! The momentum that produced record sales volume in 2021 carried into the new year, as Q1 generated 29 South Coast sales totaling $151 million (excluding hotels), both record values for a first quarter. On top of that, hotel sales topped $64 million. This presents a stark contrast to the previous two years, which both started slowly with relatively constricted deal flow in the first quarter. In 2021, most of the surplus volume was in sales of Santa Barbara property; however, during Q1 the action shifted to Goleta where 10 sales and $95 million of non-hotel volume traded, nearly triple the average quarterly production. By contrast, sales activity in Santa Barbara was level with historical averages, and Carpinteria saw just one sale of $1.2 million. Among Goleta’s sales, two off-market transactions were especially notable in terms of size and price. In January, the 72,000 SF class A office building at 6500 Hollister Ave was purchased by an investor for $21 million. More recently, the six-building industrial/R&amp;D campus on 11.9 acres at 315-346 Bollay Dr &amp; 320-340 Storke Rd was purchased by Majestic Asset Management for $50.6 million. By our count, it’s the fourth highest price ever recorded for a commercial (non-hotel) property on the South Coast. This sale affirms Majestic’s role as the most prominent value-add management firm on the South Coast, having completed five major acquisitions in as many years, totaling 750,000 SF. Hospitality property sales continued apace in Q1. The 158-key Kimpton Goodland Hotel at 5650 Calle Real in Goleta traded hands for $33 million. The buyer is reportedly a New York-based team specializing in “distressed” hospitality assets, and the price was well below what the seller had paid for the property in 2015. There were also two notable hotel sales in Santa Barbara: local developer Ed St. George purchased the 53-key Franciscan Inn at 109 Bath St for $21 million; and the Quality Inn at 3055 De La Vina St was purchased by a local investor for $9.7 million at the close of the quarter. In Santa Barbara, a bizarre sequence led to the former Girls Inc property at 531 E Ortega St changing ownership twice within a matter of days. The 1.5-acre property was purchased by a local developer planning to build multifamily housing. However, the City reportedly wasn’t receptive to the scale of the project, and five days after taking ownership the developer sold the property to Providence School for its own use. In another owner-user purchase, a dental practice purchased the 8,416 SF retail/office building at 331 N Milpas St in order to occupy part of the building and lease the remainder. Despite these examples of owner-user sales, three quarters of the buyers in Santa Barbara were investors. Most notably, the 10,600 SF office building at 118 E Carrillo St was purchased by a 1031 Exchange investor for $7.5 million in an off-market transaction. For the South Coast as a whole, owner-users completed 31% of transactions, which is a decrease from the historical trend. With just 43 properties on the market for sale, inventory is at its lowest level in five years. However, due to strong demand, 55% of Q1 sales were off-market, and many properties are going under contract either before they make it to market or within a few weeks of doing so. The Fed’s interest rate increases haven’t dampened demand, so far. A relatively large proportion of buyers on the South Coast don’t require financing because they can pay cash or are funded by a 1031 Exchange, so our market is less impacted than most by rising interest rates. At the same time, the root cause of rising interest rates—inflation—may also be driving demand among investors, as real estate is widely heralded as a hedge against inflation. For all these reasons, in the coming quarters we are likely to see sustained demand and sales volume despite relatively low inventory. Lockheed Martin has been a longtime tenant at 346 Bollay Dr at the 195,000 SF industrial/flex campus in Goleta, sold for $50.6 million. OFFICE LEASING Santa Barbara’s office market continues to grapple with surplus inventory. There are 90 spaces available, and vacancy rate has been above 9% for five consecutive quarters (refer to Table 1). The biggest lease in Q1 was UCLA Health’s signing of the entire 21,900 SF building at 111 E Victoria St for a 10-year term. Also of note, Mercer Advisors leased the 6,200 SF top floor of 222 E Carrillo St, and 5,000 SF at 28 W Figueroa St was leased by Bungalo805, the forthcoming lounge/club for kids and their parents. Marketing for the office conversion of the former Nordstrom building at 651 Paseo Nuevo is expected to launch in Q2. As with the Ortega Building at the other end of Paseo Nuevo, the offering will consist of newly remodeled floor plates for large tenants. There have reportedly been multiple parties interested in the Ortega Building since marketing commenced a year ago, but no deals have been signed to date. Given current sparse demand in the market, finding tenants for these buildings is likely to take considerable time. Taking a closer look at Santa Barbara’s elevated vacancy, we see that larger office spaces represent a disproportionate share of the growth in inventory during the current cycle. Seven years ago, Santa Barbara’s office market reached a cyclical low of 45 available spaces. Since then the number of available spaces has doubled, while the number of spaces larger than 5,000 SF has tripled to 31 currently available. For reference, 5,000 SF can accommodate roughly 30 office workers. Given average leasing volume over the past five years, Santa Barbara is carrying almost three years’ worth of inventory in this 5,000-plus SF range. By contrast, the available spaces smaller than 5,000 square feet represent less than one year’s worth of inventory. In other words, conditions do not seem to favor bringing new large spaces to the market. Goleta’s office vacancy continues to trace the opposite trajectory compared to Santa Barbara. The rate is below 5% for the first time since before the pandemic and is near the historical low (refer to Table 1). Demand is relatively healthy but appears to be fickle, and aside from renewals, deal flow was very limited in Q1. UCSB subleased 10,800 SF at 420 S Fairview Ave, which is about half of the space that Sientra relinquished for sublease there; the other half is still on the market. Other than that, the transactions were dominated by renewals, including Raytheon’s securing of 15,000 SF at 115 Robin Hill Rd and Reaction 35’s renewal of 10,250 SF at 861 Ward Dr. There are a few small spaces newly on the market, but the spaces above 5,000 SF have been available for 487 days on average, most of which have older finishes or class B features contributing to their lingering on the market. Newly remodeled spaces are leasing more readily. In Carpinteria, there were no office transactions signed in Q1. The vacancy rate popped into double digits with the emergence of two large availabilities. First, Procore offered for sublease the second floor of 6267 Carpinteria Ave—25,000 SF of creative office on the bluff. Second, three spaces totaling 19,398 SF are available at 1013-1017 Mark Ave, much of which is office conversion of former warehouse space at a bargain rate. After successfully building and leasing four new flex buildings in Goleta, RAF Pacifica Group is proceeding with plans to construct a new 80,000 SF office building at 6380 Via Real in Carpinteria for delivery in late 2023. Given current market conditions, it may prove that new office space in Carpinteria is a bit harder to lease than new flex space in Goleta, but time will tell. UCLA Health leased 111 E Victoria St, a 21,900 SF building in downtown Santa Barbara. RETAIL LEASING Santa Barbara’s largest retail lease to date occurred on Upper State Street, where the lower level of the former Sears building at 3845 State St was leased by Mattress Mike’s Furniture Gallery. Approximately 20% of this 72,750 SF space was subleased to Moving Miss Daisy consignment and antiques. The 76,300 SF upper floor is still for lease. Downtown State Street’s vacancy remains elevated, with 14.7% of storefronts on the 400 to 1300 blocks available and/or vacant. This “storefront vacancy” has been in double digits for four years, which has to be accepted now as the new normal. Returning to the 6-8% vacancy range would require a number of spaces to be repurposed for non-retail use and/or a substantial change in consumer behavior in the downtown corridor, neither of which are evident in the near horizon but could be brought about over time. In addition to the sheer number of storefronts, it bears noting that many of the vacancies are quite large spaces. The four largest available spaces on the State Street corridor, the former Macy’s (ground floor), Forever 21, Staples, and Rite Aid combined represent approximately 100,000 SF of vacancy. Two State Street leases were signed in Q1, both restaurants: L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele leased the former Embermill space at 1031 State St, and Beans BBQ is already up and grilling in the former Saigon space at 1230-A State St. Paseo Nuevo has seen an uptick in activity, adding four tenants recently, including City Hats, clothing stores Cindy ’n Claire and Pink Browny, and Pura Vida Coffee. With these leases, Pacific Retail, which owns and manages most of the center, is reporting 6.4% vacancy (not including the former Macy’s and Nordstrom buildings). In addition, SitelineSB.com reported that a CycleBar spinning gym franchise appears to be coming to Paseo Nuevo this fall. Meanwhile, Coast Village Road has been bustling with diners and shoppers as if the pandemic never happened. There are only three available retail spaces facing Coast Village Road, which are listed at an average rate of $7.50 gross per SF (compared to $4.25 gross on average for the State Street corridor). The largest of the available spaces is the former Cava restaurant at 1212 Coast Village Rd, which attracted offers from multiple tenants soon after being listed and is expected to lease in Q2. Rumor has it that the head chef behind the Michelin-star rated Sushi Bar at the Montecito Inn will be launching his own restaurant in the Funk Zone. In Goleta, Q1 brought a flurry of five small leases totaling 6,500 SF at the Plaza Shopping Center just west of Costco. This followed five transactions at that center in 2021, including the 21,350 SF anchor space leased by Planet Fitness. In Isla Vista, the pandemic’s disruption of student life proved especially hard on retail tenants. There are six spaces totaling 8,000 SF available there, more than double the pre-pandemic norm. Compared to Isla Vista, the rest of the Goleta Valley has followed the opposite trend with available space contracting by 20% since the beginning of 2020. The three neighborhood centers in the eastern area of the city—Magnolia Center, Calle Real Center, and Fairview Center—all have some vacant spaces, but overall, inventory is tight in Goleta, as suggested by the 1.9% vacancy rate (refer to Table 1). Los Angeles-based L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele will fire up the former Embermill space at 1031 State St. INDUSTRIAL LEASING Santa Barbara has seen several industrial spaces come available since year-end. Three newish buildings totaling 9,300 SF at 35 N Calle Cesar Chavez came back on the market, previously leased by Andros Floor Design. A mix of sublease and direct lease space totaling 8,500 SF became available at The Platform at 126 E Haley St. And if you aren’t looking to spend $3.00-plus per SF on either of those properties, a less pricey option is the 7,140 SF clear-span building at 726 Cacique St that just hit the market. Meanwhile, Q1 produced only two transactions, including a 6,000 SF lease by Golden Gate Communications at 427 Olive St. The net result was a slight expansion of inventory, but the vacancy rate is still below 1%. One of Goleta’s largest industrial leases ever was signed at 6759-6789 Navigator Way, a deal securing 71,300 SF across three buildings in RAF Pacifica’s new development in Cabrillo Business Park. The entire 120,000 SF campus leased before the buildings were complete, which indicates the strength of demand for new construction, especially in the industrial market. In another significant signing, Pacific Design Technology renewed 38,000 SF at 6300 Lindmar Dr. Looking at supply, two spaces totaling 77,000 SF have come to market in the past six months at 26 Castilian Dr and 147-149 Castilian Dr. Meanwhile, the 42,600 SF former Inogen space at 326 Bollay Dr is back on the market under new ownership, being the one vacant building in the 195,000 SF campus just purchased by Majestic Asset Management as noted above in the sales summary. The vacancy rate has crept up to 4.2%, but based on leasing activity early in Q2, it is projected to return to around 3% by midyear (refer to Table 1). In Carpinteria, there are just two spaces available, the larger being 24,030 SF for sublease from Procore at 6384 Via Real. There were three transactions in Q1, which is above-average volume in Carpinteria. Two leases totaling 14,500 SF were signed at 1025 Cindy Ln, while 8,100 SF at 1010 Cindy Ln was signed by Twenty Four 7 Moving. After dipping a bit during the past two years, both asking and achieved rates have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Space coming to market in Q2 will likely bring the vacancy rate above 4% soon. RAF Pacifica’s newly constructed flex buildings in Cabrillo Business Park in Goleta are fully leased after a 71,300 SF deal in Q1. Radius Insight: 2020Q1 South Coast Market Report Guest Authors: The Radius Team Raduys Commercial Real Estate Investment COVID-19 and Commercial Real Estate A lot can change in three months. While we started the year discussing how long the bull market may continue, we ended the first quarter of 2020 questioning when and if it may again be safe to shake on a deal. Literally. This is a trying time on all fronts. Every person around the world is impacted by the spread of the novel coronavirus, and though it may feel a little shallow to consider the effects of COVID-19 on the commercial real estate industry, our job as professionals is to ensure our clients are fully prepared to move forward with recovery. We will get through this. Our generation (let’s face it, EVERYONE is in this together) has certainly seen tragedy and hard times. The events of 9-11 and the Great Recession come to mind. This is different. For most of us it feels like the world has ground to a complete halt, with the exception of our essential workers and frontline healthcare heroes who thankfully are trudging along because they must. But if you look closely, beyond our empty streets and 2-D television screens, you’ll see the heart of our economy still beats. In fact there are workers out there every day doing what they can to keep the economy moving. Restaurants working behind closed doors have evolved into small grocery co-ops and delivery services. Companies are actively seeking out warehouse and industrial space to store goods that are being ordered online and shipped direct to consumer. Others are transitioning their manufacturing to meet immediate needs big and small, everything from creating test kits to sewing masks. Yes, this is our economy for now. That will change in time. We have talked with many of you over the past few weeks and will continue to reach out. One common question we’re hearing right now, from landlords and tenants, buyers and sellers, is “What should I do?” Because we are in unchartered territory, there are many underlying considerations and certainly a wealth of sometimes contradictory opinions. But where we are trying to focus the conversation is around communication. The fact is we are living in a fluid situation, and now more than ever we need to talk. Perhaps nowhere is that more important than between landlords and tenants. We would advise clients to be honest and open in these conversations, and to seek flexibility wherever possible. For example, while there are restrictions in place for certain types of evictions, those will not always be there and landlords will look to be made whole. If you are a tenant who has been truly impacted by current events, be prepared to open your books to your landlord. For the owners, we would advise trying to be creative, where possible, with agreements that give some respite now but with the understanding that it is recouped in the long term, either through an extended lease or through a payment plan, for example. On the sales side we believe there could be opportunities for buyers coming up depending on their sources of income. Lending is still happening, but be prepared for hiccups that may come along depending on a lender’s level of comfort with this new economy. Sellers need to consider whether now is truly the best time to go to market, and if they do they should be prepared for deals to take longer. And on our end, know that your commercial real estate professional will be there to guide you through the process. Almost daily we receive new information on changing regulations, guidelines and best practices in transacting commercial real estate. There has never been a more challenging time to consider going it alone, so we strongly encourage you to pick up the phone. The Radius Team will work with you to find answers, solutions and success. Commercial Sales Summary: What a Difference a Quarter Makes The recent “Corona Crisis” has sent everyone into lockdown, thrown all financial markets into a tailspin and brought commercial real estate activity to a crawl. Since none of us have lived through a crisis that included both a pandemic and stock market meltdown, it is difficult if not impossible to predict the direction of the market. We do think it is safe to say that most investors will be cautious observers for the immediate future, watching to see how and when we recover from these setbacks. Financing and available credit will also be key to restoring some stability in the market for both investors and owner-users. It seems like just yesterday when we reported year-end statistics and status for 2019, noting a market that was humming along with some pretty stable numbers for sales and increasing totals in dollar volume. While the number of deals during the first quarter of 2020 are somewhat normal, boy how times have changed. From January through March we did see 15 commercial sales on the South Coast, matching the first quarter totals in both 2019 and 2018. What has changed dramatically is dollar volume. This year we slipped down to just $39.2MM, or roughly 38% of Q1 2019 ($104MM), and about 19% of Q4 2019 ($210.6MM). Difficult to say if any trend is to be deduced given current circumstances, but again all eyes will be on the coming several quarters. The largest sale during the first quarter was an office building at 1145 Eugenia Pl. in Carpinteria. This 27,772sf building traded for $9MM, which represents a 6% cap if the building was fully leased (9,000sf is vacant). Other notable sales included a 7,000sf office building with two apartment units at 115 E. Micheltorena St.—previously home to the accounting firm MacFarlane Faletti &amp; Co.—which sold for $5.6MM to an owner-occupant; and the two-story, 13,241sf retail building at 524 State Street—the former Scientology building—which sold for $5.7MM. The buyer in that one was a group of investors with plans to transform the property into a boutique hotel. By the numbers, during the quarter there were eight (8) office sales, two (2) industrial sales, one (1) land sale, and four (4) retail sales. Once again, owner-users outnumbered investors 10-to-5. Needless to say, most of these transactions were in advanced stages of escrow before the Corona Crisis. For now, we are all paying special attention to the progress of the pandemic for our own health and well-being. As business people, we are also closely watching the effects of the federal government’s interventions to see if that will help soften the blow and get everyone back on their economic feet in the near future. As history has shown, the South Coast has tended to fair better than other markets during slowdowns. Only time will tell. Multifamily Sales Summary Santa Barbara County The year started with multifamily sales activity in the local market continuing as previous quarters, but the first quarter of 2020 ended on uncertain footing along with all financial markets as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. While the stock market and and the commercial real estate industry are getting hit substantially as the financial impacts of the virus are difficult to quantify, multifamily real estate still remains the safest of investment real estate property types due to the constant need for housing, no matter the circumstances. With other commercial sectors like retail obviously getting hit harder and with instability in equity markets, multifamily may strengthen as investors seek stability. Furthermore, our local Santa Barbara communities, a long-time safe haven for investors, has shown resistance to the pandemic due to its geography, roughly 100 miles from the nearest metropolitan area, and lower density than other areas in California. Before the pandemic gathered steam, very little inventory had traded in our region. As usual, a high number of investors continued to be in the hunt for opportunties, but most properties ended up trading off market. With this low inventory, there were really only three highlight sales in the County, one in Isla Vista, one in Santa Barbara and one in Santa Maria. Again, none of these assets were broadly marketed. The largest of these was the sale of the Breakpointe and Coronado complexes, two student housing assets in Isla Vista totaling 149 units. The deal closed at $73,700,000 or roughly $495,000/unit, despite trading just three years ago for roughly 70% of that price. The new owner was able to capitalize on a minor rehabilitation of the assets, low interest rates and pent-up investor demand for student housing, quietly marketing the offering and ultimately selling on a by-the-bed basis. Selling student housing assets by the bed has helped owners increase their sale price per unit by maximizing revenue for skilled operators who can utilize this leasing strategy. Interestingly enough the asset sold just before the closure of the UCSB campus. Even though the school remains shut down, rent collections are still hovering around 80 – 90 percent and pre-leasing is still occurring. The major question remains whether UCSB will open on schedule for the fall quarter. If it doesn’t, rent collections may drop next year and landlords could have a harder time enforcing leases. The other two highlight sales were in the city of Santa Barbara and Santa Maria, both being sizeable off-market transactions. An 18-unit building at 401 W. Los Olivos St., Santa Barbara near Cottage Hospital and consisting of all studio units closed for $4.7 million. Both the buyer and seller had new hurdles to climb with fresh state and local rent legislation—including the AB1482 rent cap bill and the City of Santa Barbara’s mandatory 1 year lease offer ordinance—creating additional paperwork. With a building such as this with below market rents, the buyers were still able to achieve attractive financing by showing upside over a longer period of time, even though the new rent cap of 5% + CPI staggers those returns over a longer period. Still, month-to-month tenancy helps as there is a naturally higher rate of turnover, allowing the new owner to more quickly achieve market rents. Meanwhile in the North County, a property at 317 – 323 N. Western Ave. sold for $5.5 million. This was a heavy value-add deal selling to a Los Angeles based investor with a concentration of assets in Santa Maria. The price per unit was $137,500, below average for Santa Maria. The next largest deal occurring in Santa Maria was at 826 W. Cook St., a 16-unit asset in a great location close to all the preferred amenities in the city. That building sold for $2.5 million or $156,200-per-door at an approximate 5.6% cap rate. Ventura Ventura experienced very low transaction volume during the first quarter with just two smaller assets selling. One was an 8-unit building at 6329 Whipporwill St. in Ventura. The other was located at 1829 E. Ocean Ave. which consisted of cottage-style units. There was also one 12-unit asset in Oxnard which came to market and quickly went into escrow. Still, the Ventura markets continue to be in high demand by investors, from Camarillo through Ventura and into Ojai. There are a few sizeable off-market deals in escrow and one or two assets possibly coming online in the coming months. San Luis Obispo San Luis Obispo did not record any sizeable transactions in Q1, similar to Ventura. There is one 13-unit student housing asset adjacent to the Cal Poly campus at 1238 E. Foothill Rd. that has seen multiple escrows and is back in escrow again, possibly closing in the next two months. According to several student housing owners, pre-leasing for the fall was slightly stronger this year than last and collections have been at approximately 80 – 90 percent despite COVID-19. Lending Update Clearly COVID- 19 has caused much disturbance to the real estate markets as tenants have borne the direct impact. The ability to earn revenue and pay rent ultimately will find its way to landlords. While this is a massive problem in retail and office real estate, tenants are receiving help paying their rent from the unprecedented government stimulus package and broadened unemployment compensation. Lenders are mostly pulling back on lending to other property types but many local and national banks are still bullish on multifamily, as they should be, since we can see that the fundamentals are still strong. Nevertheless, risk is still increasingly prevalent as, over the short term, unemployment will hamper asking and achieved rents from apartment tenants. To compensate for this additional risk, many lenders are increasing their debt service coverage ratios and although the federal funds rate is 0%, interest rates are flat to possibly increasing slightly, and appraisals are coming in more conservative as well. Still, there is money out there for multifamily and relationship lending is the name of the game. Local banks want to keep their relationship clients happy and are doing their best to extend credit to strong clients at numbers that aren’t too far off from before the pandemic. South Coast Leasing Summary Over the past 20 years, Radius has been publishing these quarterly market reports providing analysis of the previous quarter while looking forward to the future. During this stretch it is arguable we have never entered a quarter with more uncertainty than the current one. While it’s abundantly clear we are all in this together for better or worse, our three main leasing sectors—industrial, office and retail—are not equal in the impact the pandemic has thrust upon us. The industrial sector in the South Coast market will perhaps weather the COVID-19 situation better than the office and retail space, as warehousing and distribution have remained relatively operational. In fact the technology sector which accounts for a substantial portion of industrial and R&amp;D square footage in our market, may prove to be the most insulated and best prepared to adapt to the turbulence created by this crisis. The only real notable change in South Coast leasing during the quarter was the Goleta industrial vacancy rate jumping by five basis points, from 5.2 percent in Q4 2019 to 9.3 percent by the end of Q1 2020. That increase was largely due to roughly 100,000 square feet of space coming available in February which was vacated by Skate One as they moved their warehouse down South. On the office front, the ability of our community to quickly transition to working from home has certainly been impressive. Video conferencing company Zoom, which has an office in downtown Santa Barbara and had previously been somewhat overshadowed by more well-known alternatives such as WebEx, GoToMeeting and even Microsoft Teams, has suddenly become a household name and is now arguably a leader in modern enterprise video communications as its virtual meeting and webinar platform has helped businesses and communities stay connected at a time when social distancing does not appropriately allow for in-person collaboration and communication. That said, while it remains difficult to ascertain if the government’s stay-at-home mandates will have lasting meaningful effect on the office leasing sector, it’s clear that many businesses who may have been in the market for new office space have largely hit the pause button on entering into new leases. Perhaps the biggest and most obvious question mark is the retail sector. Our local retailers have had to endure many challenges over the past several years in the form of the fires and mudslides that devastated our communities as well as the increased popularity of online shopping, and current circumstances have dealt yet another gut-punch from which to find a way to recover. We have discussed at length the State Street conundrum in particular in past reports and recent events will likely put our struggling “main drag” under even more immense pressure and scrutiny. But the South Coast market’s traditional lack of new supply of office, industrial and retail space may turn out to be somewhat of a saving grace, allowing us to maneuver these uncertain times in better shape than other markets. During these unprecedented times communication between landlords and existing tenants will undoubtedly be paramount. Landlords will need to understand that tenants’ monthly payment obligations may need to be temporarily modified in order to keep the tenant’s business viable. At the same time tenants will need to understand that landlords have (at minimum) fixed building expenses such as mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc. that need to be met. The bottom line is all parties are taking it on the chin right now, so we all need to be in each other’s corner if we’re going to make it through these rounds. Today we are in unchartered territory, understatement of the year. But by the end of the second quarter we should start to see a clearer picture of the fallout of this crisis as well as the path forward. Santa Maria Real Estate Market – 2022 Can This Be Sustained Guest Authors: Steve McCarty and Steve Davis Stafford-McCarty Commercial Real Estate Key Chapter Findings Covid Impacts Escalating construction costs The Demand for Housing Supply Chain Issues Residential Index With a frenzied climate for homes sales, the Santa Maria market median price has risen from $455,000 in 2020 to $528,500 in 2021 (refer to Table 1). Transaction velocity has remained relatively consistent over the 5 years; Santa Maria residential sales have averaged a touch over 1,034 single family residential (SFR) units per year. All cash buyers are setting the price of move-in ready homes. However, with interest rates rising, residential realtors are starting to report price drops. New Inventory of Homes to Come The approximate 146 acre project known as Blosser Southeast (bordered by Blosser, Stowell, Depot and Battles) will be a major mixed-use project for the City with a reported entitlement of over 1,500 units of varying densities along with community facilities and recreation open space. Other noted transactions: The former drive-in cinema sold to Peoples Self Help Housing and a nearby Latter Day Saints parcel of 4.83 acres in Orcutt slated to be sold to a local builder. Table 1 Retail/Commercial There is less retail vacancy on the market this year compared to last year. The current vacant retail inventory is approximately 3.7% (approximately 191,800 sq. ft. on a base of +/- 5,191,601 sq. ft.); improving from last year’s 4.78%, and further improving from 10.01% in 2018 (refer to Table 2). Overall, the retail market is continuing to see shifts in the market from formerly viable, single tenant destination locations to either freeway visible/ high traffic corridors, or larger multi-tenant destination complexes. Larger buildings are being divided into smaller retail spaces to fit the current market. Case in point: The former Costco at 1335 S Bradley Road sold for $9,700,000. The building is 125,708 sq. ft. on 8.48 acres; sale price was $77.16/sq.ft. Efforts are currently underway to re-tenant the building with smaller, (but still good sized) tenants and potentially turn the rear portion of the building into warehouse space. Adjacent property, 1423 South Bradley, sold for $9,600,000 and included three assets in the sale: Roadhouse Grill - 1.93 acres, Hometown Buffet - 1.77 acres, and the Office Depot - 1.91 acres. Current discussions include potentially removing the Roadhouse Grill to repurpose the assets. Local auto dealerships have relocated, built state of the art facilities and are now open at Enos Ranch facing US 101. More car dealers are reported to be coming to the market. Multi-tenant Retail Locations Several new retail locations are proposed in the market at the intersections of Union Valley Parkway and Highway135. As noted in previous reports, there is still more development on the books: Westgate Marketplace – approximately 68,000 sq. ft. Orcutt Plaza – approximately 225,000 sq. ft. Orcutt Marketplace – approximately 295,000 sq. ft. Existing Inventory Sales The former Wellenkamp’s building at 204 North Blosser (28,800 sq. ft. on 1.91 acres) sold for $2,300,000, or $79.86/sq.ft. 411 S. Blosser $1,125,000 8,450 sq.ft. 15,000 sq. ft. $133.14 sq. ft. 1543 Stowell Center Plaza $1,040,000 7,500 sq. ft. $138.67 sq. ft. There is a redevelopment focus by the City of Santa Maria on its downtown core which proposes a higher density and a more pedestrian friendly environment. The former Mervyns/Fallas sale noted above is in conjunction with surplus City owned land offered for development in the “old town” area—which were the origins of the City of Santa Maria. This property is across from the mall which is still challenged to fill vacancies. Generally, retail land values are still holding and can range from $18.00 per sq. ft. to retail pad pricing at approximately $50 per square foot. A Pad sale on South Blosser just south of Main Street sold for $1,000,000 for a proposed Taco Bell. 2.89 acres on Betteravia as part of the Betteravia Plaza project sold for $3,147,000, approximately $25 per sq. ft., to gas station operators. Table 2 Office In contrast to other regional and national markets, the local office market is bucking the trend and has not seen the large increase in vacancies. In fact, it has improved and is the lowest it has been since 2008, and now stands at 7.62% with 93,617 sq. ft. vacant (refer to Table 3). The makeup of the Santa Maria office market has not been affected as much as other tech rich markets, such as San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, as Santa Maria’s workforce has fewer opportunities to work from home. Again, construction costs continue to escalate making tenant improvements expensive and resulting in higher rents. Buildouts can be $150 per sq. ft. over a shell interior for typical product. There still exists the dichotomy in the market: new or newer buildings dealing with higher construction costs have pushed rents over $2.00 and up to $3.00 NNN per sq. ft. Owners of older inventory, depending upon its location and age, are luring tenants with rents from $1.00 to $1.50 gross rent. Older office sales are under $200 per sq. ft. 2100 South Blosser Road, an approximately 58,800 sq. ft. repurposed facility, sold to Community Health Centers for $9,200,000 or approximately $156 per sq. ft. Table 3 Industrial The demand for industrial space is increasing. The Covid pandemic has affected all commercial market sectors. For industrial, the demand for having inventory on hand for production has increased warehousing requirements, suppliers want to ship from their own inventory to assure their customers of product. This translates to increased warehousing which already is in very tight supply, not only for the Santa Maria Valley but for the entire region. Industrial vacancy has decreased from 2020’s 4%, and is now 2.38% (refer to Table 4). For 2021, the base inventory has had modest gains (meaning few new buildings), but remains at approximately 8,600,000 sq. ft. There was a modest number of industrial transactions again for 2021. A well located, older concrete block building sold for $1,890,000 which works out to +/- $85.59 sq. ft, a below-market transaction for nearly 22,080 sq. ft on 1.27 acres. This value is still estimated to be below the cost of reproduction as building costs continue to climb. Sought-after industrial properties are 10,000-20,000 sq. ft. buildings with a dock and a component of outside storage. Reproduction value for this type of property can be over $200 per sq. ft. Given that Santa Maria has a significant agricultural base and support industries, buildings with enclosed yard space are, and have been, in regular demand. Industrial rents, as predicted, are moving up. For newer industrial space, owners are asking $0.85 to $1.00 sq. ft./mo. NNN. Rental asking rates for flex space, from 1,500 sq.ft. units and larger, are approximately $0.75 to $0.85 sq. ft. gross. Older, second or third generation space rents are typically $0.50 to $0.70 modified gross. Industrial land is in the $6 to $12 per sq. ft. range depending upon level of finish, size and location. A few examples: 1840 West Betteravia, 3.2 acres of industrial land sold at $1,150,636 ($8.25 per sq. ft.) Lot 10 Roemer Way, Donahue Trucking purchased 1.53 acres of finished parcel with freeway visibility for $780,000 for $11.70 per sq. ft. Table 4 Running out of room for Industrial As noted in past articles, the largest single area of industrial fee land is known as Area 9. The planning concept was to supply the City of Santa Maria with many options to grow its industrial base and provide for head of household jobs. Windset Farms located here and has since expanded with its state of the art greenhouses–over 5 million sq. ft.– consuming so much acreage the City is now essentially out of ground for industrial land. The remaining commercial ground in the Area 9 plan lacks infrastructure and is also in competition with the expanding need for residential uses. Agricultural Although the 172.71 acre Donavan Ranch sold to berry grower Cal Giant in late 2020 for $11,000,000, it still represents a key berry and ag ground sale at approximately $63,700 an acre. This falls in line with the values which have been holding for the last 5 years in which berry and ground suitable for row crops are still in the $55,000 to $65,000 an acre range. Planted vineyards have been valued at approximately $60,000 per acre and plantable ground can be $36,000 and higher. The Cannabis Factor: for the tenants and buyers within the few communities in which cannabis businesses can operate, the parameters (zoning, land use, political support, etc.) in short are simply confusing. Rents and values we have previously reported are way over market (this can be 100% over) and those financial upsides can vanish as well. This narrow segment is still sorting itself out. Commercial Investment There were just a few investment sales in the Santa Maria market in 2021.A professional office building sold at 1010 South Broadway, 10,822 sq. ft. for $1,800,000 or $166 per sq. ft., a 6.1 Cap. Most of the income based sales have been multifamily sales. The Multi Listing Service reported 26 sales under $2,500,000, the vast majority of which were under a million dollars and transacted through residential brokers. Value ranges are between $200-$425 per sq. ft (depending upon age and condition) and are between $170,000 and $315,000 per unit. They sold quickly, mostly less than 30 days on market and very near asking price. Cap rates are sub 4.5 (refer to Table 5). In contrast to speedy improved property transactions, land zoned for apartments has taken a while to sell. Typically the zoning is R-3 and sells for approximately $17 to $24 per sq. ft. 502 Barcellus, an age-restricted project on 2.3 acres, sold for $2,400,000 or $23.95 per sq. ft. after being on the market for 5 years. Table 5 Summary Real estate confidence has been strong these past years. The irony is that market demand would support even more sales at market high prices; however sellers are then challenged to find exchange properties for tax purposes, many with low bases for valuation. Furthermore, sellers do not want to be forced into buying a high priced replacement property just to avoid the taxes. A typical seller will comment: “Sure I may sell at that price, but what would I do with the money?” With increased construction costs, supply chain disruption, Covid constraints combined with regulation and compliance issues, not to mention increasing interest rates and inflation, is it any wonder that things may soon change from the robust real estate market? Notes: For the purpose of this report, databank numbers include functional, selected non-competitive inventory (older buildings and warehouses) and excludes non-market square footage such as mini-storage, airport hangers, etc. A Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate) is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income (NOI—which does not include debt service) by the purchase price, e.g. $100,000 NOI/ $1,500,000 purchase price equals .0667 or a 6.67 cap rate. "],["comm.html", "6 Community 6.1 Demographics 6.2 Crime 6.3 Education 6.4 Environment", " 6 Community 6.1 Demographics Key Points: Santa Barbara County’s population began to grow last year, reversing a three-year decline, but it declined again this year. Meanwhile, the tri-county area as a whole is experiencing its fifth consecutive year of population decline. Net migration to Santa Barbara County has been steadily decreasing since 2016, with the largest decrease in the recorded data occurring in 2021. Santa Barbara’s white and black population are declining, while populations of other ethnicities are increasing. 6.1.1 Local Demographics The tri-counties area is composed of Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, and San Luis Obispo Counties. In 2024, population growth is negative at -0.25%. Population growth for the tri-counties has not returned to its peak in the recorded data of about 0.9% in 2013 and 2014. Santa Barbara County recorded positive population growth of 0.34%. Population growth in San Luis Obispo County was positive at 0.36%. Ventura County experienced negative population growth of -0.77%. The overall decline in the tri-counties population was therefore driven by Ventura County. In Santa Barbara County specifically, unincorporated areas experienced the highest growth rate in 2024 at 4.51%. On the other hand, many areas of Santa Barbara County experienced negative growth. These areas include Buellton, Carpinteria, and Goleta, etc. Among cities with a negative growth rate, Solvang faced the lowest growth rate, at -2.54%. 6.1.2 Components of Change According to data from the California Department of Finance, the population in Santa Barbara County as of July 2023 was lower in July of 2022. The -1.96% population decrease from July 2020 to July 2021 was the largest decrease in the county population since the data began in 2011. While births in the county outnumbered deaths by 1,608 in 2023, net migration was negative at -3,378. Net migration in California as a whole was negative in 2023, with population growth of -0.1%. 6.1.3 Demographic Detail Incorporated areas of Santa Barbara County are expected to see population increase to 447,600 in 2024, up from 425,000 in 2022. Within the increasing population, there is no clear trend of groups of age demographics that are significantly increasing or decreasing. Similarly, gender groups do not indicate significant differences. However, change of population is seen more clearly in ethnicities in Santa Barbara County. The white population has decreased since 2016, while the Black, Asian and Hispanic populations have increased. 6.1.4 Median Age The median age in the recorded areas of Santa Barbara County is expected to be 36.4 in 2024. Guadalupe has the lowest median age, at 31.11 years old, and Solvang has the highest median age at 52.13 years old. 6.1.5 Housing According to the Department of Finance, there are a total of 161,456 housing units in Santa Barbara County in 2023. This is a 0.7% increase from the housing unit count of 160,333 last year in 2022. By comparison, the population increased by 0.34% from 2022 to 2023. Furthermore, the vacancy rate decreased by 0% from 6.2 to 6.2 in the past year. Housing density has decreased from 2.8 people per household in 2022 to 2.77 people per household in 2023. South Santa Barbara County has a higher percentage of one- and two-person households than North Santa Barbara County, while North Santa Barbara County has higher percentages of three-, four-, five-, six-, and seven-person households. Two-person households are the most common all across Santa Barbara County, accounting for over 30% of households in both North and South Santa Barbara County. Family households outnumber non-family households in every city in Santa Barbara County, with the smallest percentage of non-family households in Guadalupe. 6.2 Crime Key Points: Santa Barbara County’s violent crime rate decreased from 3.86 to 3.85 crimes per 1,000 persons from 2021 to 2022. Solvang had the lowest property crime rate and Santa Maria the highest in 2022. Guadalupe had the lowest violent crime rate and Santa Maria the highest in 2022. Over the past 10 years (2013-2022), property crime rates decreased and violent crime rates increased county wide by -14.78% and 16.17%, respectively. Compared to the United States, Santa Barbara County had 0.05 greater property crimes per 1,000 persons in 2022, with property crime rates of 19.54 and 19.59, respectively. In terms of violent crime rates, the United States had 3.81 and Santa Barbara County 3.85 crimes per 1,000 persons in 2022. In what follows, we discuss these trends and further break down the composition of crime. 6.2.1 Property Crime As defined by the California Department of Justice, property crime is divided into three separate categories: burglary, motor vehicle theft, and larceny-theft. Larceny-theft made up 64.86% of property crimes in 2022, totaling 5,658 crimes. The high percentage of this type of crime is most likely attributed to the ease with which individuals can steal and resell items, such as theft of motor vehicle parts, shoplifting, and bicycle theft. Motor vehicle theft, which totaled 1,881 and constituted 21.56% of the all property crime, is the second most perpetrated type. Burglary made up the smallest category at 13.57%. Santa Barbara County’s property crime rates decreased by 9.04% in 2022. Lompoc had the largest decrease, with property crimes falling by -6.49%. Solvang maintained the lowest property crime rate at 11.6 and Santa Maria the highest property crime rate at 27.75 in the county in 2022. 6.2.2 Violent Crime Violent crime is separated into four sections: aggravated assault, homicide, rape, and robbery. Aggravated assault made up 65.17% of violent crimes in Santa Barbara County in 2022, totaling 1,117 and thereby making it the largest category of violent crimes within the county. Homicide made up the smallest fraction of violent crimes at 1.23%, with just 21 counts. Robbery and rape made up the second and third largest categories of violent crimes, respectively. In total, the number of violent crimes per 1,000 persons in Santa Barbara County decreased from 3.86 in 2021 to 3.85 in 2022. Carpinteria had the largest increase, with violent crimes rising by 42%. Guadalupe maintained the lowest violent crime rate at 0.6 and Santa Maria maintained the highest violent crime rate in the county at 6.49 in 2022. 6.2.3 Crime Rates by City 6.3 Education Key Points: Charter school enrollment in Santa Barbara County, which had been growing for several years, is lower now than in 2018-2019. Enrollment at the University of California, Santa Barbara has declined slightly from its record high in Fall 2022. The high school dropout rate of 4% in Santa Barbara County in the 2022-23 school year was substantially lower than the California average of 6.5%. Public school enrollment in Santa Barbara County dropped by -0.16% between the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, a decrease of -106 students. The California Department of Education predicts that public school enrollment will shrink by 5.6 between 2024 and 2031. Is the decline driven by a decrease in the number of school-age children or by a shift to private schools? Private school enrollment has increased in Santa Barbara County since 2018, and in 2022 it reached 5484, its highest point since the data began in 2014. Therefore, the increase in public school enrollment appears to be driven by a increase in the number of school-age children in Santa Barbara County. Charter schools, which are considered public schools, have recently lost popularity: charter school enrollment has declined from its 2018-2019 peak of 7.2% of total enrollment to 6.8% of total enrollment. The University of California, Santa Barbara enrolled 26,068 students in Fall 2023, a 1.4% decrease from the record high of 26,421 in Fall 2022. Allan Hancock College registration increased from 11,977 in 2022 to 12,866 in 2023, remaining well below its peak of 16,066 in Fall 2008. Santa Barbara City College enrolled 13,427 students in the fall, a -19% decrease from Fall 2022 but still 32% below its peak enrollment in Fall 2009. 6.3.1 Expenditures on Education Using the following figures, we display the year-to-year changes in education expenditures at the state, county, and district level. These expenditures include the following costs: salaries, benefits, acquisitions, and construction. To measure these changes, we use the cost per average daily attendance (ADA), which measures the number of days of student attendance divided by the total number of days of instruction. At the state and county levels, expenditures per ADA continued the upward trend that began in 2013. For the 2022-23 school year, expenditures per ADA for the state and county rose by 9.2% and 9.4%, respectively. Within Santa Barbara county, spending per student varies substantially across school districts. None of the 20 districts experienced declines in spending per ADA. Montecito Union Elementary has the highest cost per ADA. When looking at the growth trend of school spending, it is helpful to also consider indicators such as average class size, student teacher ratios, and other performance measures to better understand the trend. For example, the increase in the cost per ADA could be attributed to either an increase in expenditures or a fall in enrollment. The rise for this year may be due in part to the decline in enrollment if education spending has not sufficiently adjusted to the decrease. Alternatively, general increases in spending could account for increased costs, although these changes cannot be directly observed. Thus, we cannot determine which of these factors is the driving force. 6.3.2 Performance Indicators Created by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), the California Assessment of Student Performance Progress (CASSPP) replaced the STAR exam in the Spring of 2014 due to state efforts to change testing from multiple choice and memorization to more interactive questions that require critical analysis skills. Since the trial run in 2013-14, the 2022-23 academic year is the ninth year of publicly released results. Santa Barbara County students performed far better in English than in either math or science: 39.2% of students met or exceeded the standard in English, compared with 28.4% in math and 25.1% in science. Although English had the lowest percentage of students who met or exceeded the standard, the percentage of students in the lowest-scoring category of “Standard Not Met” was highest for math at 46.4%. A higher percentage of 11th grade students met or exceeded standards in English than 3rd or 5th grade students. In 2013, the California State Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science Standards which focuses on creating a shift in science education to have students express more conceptual and applied understanding of the material. California Science Test (CAST) results were made available for the first cohort of students in 2019. The 2022-23 results show that the majority of students (54.9%) nearly meet the standard for science, while 17.9% meet the standard and only 7.2% exceed it. Students younger than grade 5 are not required to take the CAST exam. The California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) was made to demonstrate a competency of English-language arts and mathematics and was required in order to earn a high school diploma. The CAHSEE was suspended in October 15 and has not been reinstated. Furthermore, our usual data for SAT scores by section is no longer available due to revisions in the test. Therefore, we are unable to present SAT testing data for the 2020-21 academic year. The four-year high school graduation rate in Santa Barbara County was 92.3% in 2023, exceeding the statewide rate of 89.1%. Out of 4713 students who graduated in 2023, 45% met the standards required to attend a University of California or California State University school. Santa Barbara County has a high school dropout rate of 4%, compared with the statewide rate of 6.5%. Among Santa Barbara County school districts, Cuyama Joint Unified has the highest graduation rate of 100%. Carpinteria Unified has the most students who received a Special Education Certificate of Completion. 6.4 Environment Key Points: Santa Barbara Country experienced a “Wet Year” with 202% of typical rainfall in 2023. Total energy use in Santa Barbara County up in 2022. In 2023, Santa Barbara County had 0 days exceeding the 8-hour state ozone standard. 6.4.1 Annual Rainfall 2023 experienced 202% of normal water-year rainfall, measured from September 1, 2022, to August 31, 2023. 2023 is therefore classified as a “Wet Year,” which Santa Barbara County defines as a year that has received more than 120% of normal rainfall. Santa Barbara County has returned to a drought after decreasing rainfall since 2018. Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez, and Santa Maria each saw an increase in rainfall compared to 2022. Santa Barbara received 37 inches of rainfall, 207% of its mean annual rainfall of 17.87 inches. Santa Maria saw 25.72 inches of rain, 289% of its mean annual rainfall of 12.82 inches. Lastly, Santa Ynez received 33.11 inches of rain, 237% of its mean annual rainfall of 15.59 inches. The 2023 water-year sees continued above average rainfall for all three cities after 2022 saw slightly below average rainfall in all three cities. 6.4.2 Water Reservoirs Cachuma, Gibraltar, and Jameson are Santa Barbara County’s major water reservoirs. Reservoir levels are measured in acre-feet (one acre-foot equals 325,851 gallons). Between December 01, 2022, and December 01, 2023, reservoir levels Cachuma increased by 112,894, increased by 2017 in Jameson, and increased by 635 in Gibraltar. These changes can simply be put into perspective by examining the overall capacity levels of each reservoir. Cachuma experienced an increase in water capacity from 31.2% to 89.7%. Jameson’s capacity increased from 50.9% to 91.5% of its maximum water levels. Lastly, the smallest reservoir, Gibraltar, rose from 20.3% to 34.2% of total capacity. Water Reservoir Lavels 2022 Avg (acre-feet) 2023 Avg (acre-feet) 1-Year Change 2-Year Change 5-Year Change Cachuma 79,087 176,478 123.1% 61.2% 149.8% Gibraltar 1,925 3,590 86.5% 743.6% 5.8% Jameson 3,010 4,624 53.6% 39.2% 53.4% 6.4.3 Water Consumption In 2020, the amount of gallons of water consumed per day for residential purposes within Santa Barbara County increased by an average of 9.69% across all reporting agencies. Water consumption had been declining in the County since 2013, largely driven by regulation due to the mostly continual drought. Between 2020 and 2019, Montecito experienced the largest increase in per-capita residential water consumption– 28%. On the other hand, Mission Hills experienced the largest decline in per-capita residential water consumption– -10.61%. In terms of magnitude, personal daily water consumption varies widely between cities. Montecito and Santa Ynez stand at the upper end of water consumption at 256 and 222 gallons per day, respectively. Casmalia reported 43 gallons per day, the lowest consumption figure in the county. 6.4.4 Air Quality The Santa Barbara Air Pollution Control District has a network of monitoring stations to record the concentration of various air pollutants. Air quality is presented in terms of the number of days the ozone level exceeded the state 8-hour standard of .070 parts per million. In the long view, Santa Barbara County has experienced air quality improvements, which can be seen in the declining number of state 1-hours and 8-hour ozone exceedance days that occurred between 1990 and 2019. Neither 2022 nor 2023 experienced any days where ozone levels exceeded the state 1-hour standard. Moreover, 2023 experienced no days where the ozone level exceeded the state 8-hour standard. 2021’s 1 exceedance day marks one of the lowest levels since 1990, when the number of state 8-hour ozone exceedance days was 87. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) monitor whether regions in the United States meet certain health standards. These standards tell us how much of a substance can be in the air without causing harm based on proven medical research. In order to receive the attainment designation for regional ozone standards, local data must show that the 8-hour standard was not violated by more than one day per year on average during the previous three calendar years. In other words, regions must not have more than three total 8-hour exceedance days for three consecutive years. Santa Barbara County has experienced 0, 0, 1 exceedance days in 2023, 2022, 2021, respectively. As a result, Santa Barbara County currently boasts the attainment status according to NAAQS.

Residential electricity, which made up 0.3% of total electricity consumption in 2022, also rose by 2.31%. The remaining category of electricity consumption, non-residential energy use, increased by 2.72%. We should expect to continue seeing a decrease in energy consumption as Santa Barbara County establishes its own renewable sources to achieve 100% sustainable energy goals by 2030 – as voted on by the City Council in June 2017.
