<p>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the value of all goods and services produced within a certain location over a certain period of time. It remains one of the best measures of economic growth and well-being, not only for the nation but also for local areas. Unlike the data on national GDP, data on GDP for Santa Barbara County is only reported annually and at a considerable lag. Typically, we rely on alternative measures to judge the health of our local economy like employment statistics and housing prices, which are released more frequently. However, GDP remains a relevant statistic to determine long-run trends in the county’s economic growth and industry mix. It also allows for a direct comparison to growth in the nation and state.</p>

<p>The main measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This index is calculated by taking the change in prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed basket of goods and services, which is representative of what a typical consumer purchases. In 2024, the CPI for the Los Angeles Area increased by 2.53%. The overall U.S. inflation in 2024 increased by a similar percentage, at 3.11%.</p>
<p>Core CPI is often thought of as the best measure of inflation. It resolves issues and concerns regarding volatility by removing food and energy from the basket of goods and services. By this measure, inflation was 4% in the Los Angeles area for 2024. Los Angeles consistently had a higher core CPI than the US from 2015 to 2020, but the trend did not persist in 2021-2024. The core CPI value for the U.S. was 0.53% lower than the value for Los Angeles in 2024. The FED hit their long-term inflation target of 2.0% for the first time in 2016 since 2008.
