<li>Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries grew by 3,651 jobs in 2025, a gain of 1.77%</li>
<li>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed stagnant in 2025 at 4.36%.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Santa Barbara County Employment</h3>
<p>Santa Barbara County’s total employment for all industries grew in 2025. Total Employment increased from 211,405 jobs in 2022 to 215,057 jobs in 2025. This gain of 3,651 workers represents an increase of 1.70%, which is higher than the previous year’s growth rate of 0.89%. Since December of 2013, Santa Barbara County has had a net gain of 12,561 jobs, averaging an increase of 1,046 jobs each year. This is a sign that the labor markets in Santa Barbara County are healthy.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara’s non-farm payroll employment stands at 186,400, reflecting a monthly decrease of 0.11% and a year-over-year decline of 0.32%. This places Santa Barbara slightly lower than the statewide trend. San Luis Obispo experienced a 0.34% monthly increase, while San Jose and Oxnard saw modest monthly growth of 0.03% and 0.16%, respectively. Over the long term, Santa Barbara’s employment trends remain stable, though still lagging behind the gains observed in larger areas like San Jose.</p>
<p>The average number of unemployed workers and the unemployment rate has stayed stagnant in the past year. The unemployment rate dropped from a high of 4.67% in 2024 to, based on the most recent data, 4.3% in 2025. The number unemployed, defined as workers who are without work and are actively seeking work, has increased from a peak of 9,700 in 2023, to 10,291 in 2024, and then down to 9,727 in 2025. This drop of 564 unemployed workers in the past year represents a decline of 5.48%. The declines in both variables have been gradually slowing down as the labor market returns to so-called “full employment”, loosely defined as the lowest possible level that will not cause inflation. If unemployment falls significantly, inflation will rise as employers compete to hire workers and push up wages too fast. The size of the labor force in Santa Barbara County has increased from 2024 to 2025 by 3,683 workers. This is an increase of 1.67%.</p>
<!-- Nonfarm payroll in California increased in 2023, at a rate of 0.21%. Since December of 2013, nonfarm payrolls have increased in California by 8.88%. The United States nonfarm payroll has also increased at a rate of 1.73%. This is significantly higher than the 2021 growth rate of 1.39%. Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll growth decreased by 0.32%, which is slightly lower compared to California. This is higher than the 2021 growth rate of 0.13%. Nonfarm payroll is indexed to July 2009, and since the end of the recession, Santa Barbara’s nonfarm payroll gains (3.67%) have been lower than both the United States’ (15.13%) and California’s (13.56%). -->

<p>Per capita net earnings constitute the majority of per capita personal income in the United States, California, and Santa Barbara County. These earnings include wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries (such as employer contributions to pension and insurance funds), and proprietors’ income, less contributions to government social insurance, and adjusted to reflect income by place of residence rather than place of work. In 2023, the per capita income of Santa Barbara County was $82,736. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) discontinued county- and metro-level data reporting starting in 2024, so no data are available beyond 2023. Santa Barbara County’s per capita income in 2023 was higher than both the California state average of $72,425 and the national average of $64,345 in 2024.</p>
